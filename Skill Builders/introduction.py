chart = px.scatter(mpg,
    x='cyl', 
    y='hwy',  
    title = 'The relationship between cyl and hwy'
)

chart.show()
#What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?

chart = px.scatter(mpg,
    x='class', 
    y='drv',  
    title = 'The relationship between class and drv'
)

chart.show()
# The plot is not useful because scatterplot requires two numerical variables while both class and drv are categorical vataibles.
