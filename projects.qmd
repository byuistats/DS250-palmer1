- [pandas User Guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/index.html)
- [Lets-Plot User Guide](https://lets-plot.org/python/pages/charts.html)
- [scikit-learn learn User Guide](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)
- [scikit-learn Tutorials](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html)
