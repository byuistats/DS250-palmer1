    "text": "“What do you mean by data science programming?”\nMost likely, you have had 1-2 courses of programming before you have taken DS 250. Unlike traditional computer science courses, DS 250 uses Python in an interactive mode instead of building programs. The data provider usually has some big questions that need answering; However, there are hundreds of little issues and responses along the way. We use programming to facilitate this investigation.\nThere are similarities with User Experience Designers. In our case, we don’t get to ask users about their experience. We use programming to ask data about its background, and each data set has its own history. We want our analysis to mold to that experience. You can think of data science programming like a first date with your data. You can’t write one long program nieve of the issues and nuances each living data set provides.\n\n\n\n“How does DS 250 compare to DS 350?”\nThe two courses have similarities. You could think of DS 250 as an introduction to data wrangling and visualization. Both classes use real-world data and are built around data science projects. There are some critical differences between the two courses.\n\nIn this course, we use Python, and DS 350 uses R.\nWe are introducing the principles of data science programming in DS 250.\nThe course is only 2-credits.\nDS 250 is intended to introduce visualization, wrangling, and modeling.\n\n\n\n\nfaq “How does DS 250 prepare me for DS 350 and CSE 450?”\nYou will be comfortable with interactive programming and have an introduction to the principles of data formats for data science applications. You will be introduced to principles related to machine learning, data wrangling, and data visualization.\n\n\n\n“What programming languages do we use in this course?”\nThe course is done using Python. We focus on the pandas and Altair packages.\n\n\n\n“What are the prerequisites for this course?”\nUsing the new courses at BYU-I, the prerequisite is CSE 110. However, if you have experience programming from other classes, you most likely are prepared for this course.\n\n\n\n“Why Python instead of R?”\nThe computer science and software engineering programs at BYU-I use Python as their foundational courses. The standard student will have some experience with Python before DS 250. Python is an essential programming language for data scientists, and we already have DS350, which is taught in R.\n\n\n\n“What is pandas?”\npandas is the foundational data science package in Python. If you are using tabular data you will be in pandas.\n\n\n\n“Why are we using Altair instead of Seaborn or Matplotlib?”\nMatplotlib was the first visualization package to gain a following in Python. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib. Many data scientists use both in their work—neither leverage the grammar of graphics as developed by Leland Wilkinson. Altair is built on Vega-Lite, which uses the Vega visualization grammar. It is declarative and actively developed. We expect that it will become the predominant visualization package in Python https://youtu.be/FytuB8nFHPQ and https://youtu.be/vTingdk_pVM.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The y parameter is set to a list [‘cty’, ‘hwy’], indicating that two sets of bars will be plotted for each manufacturer, one for ‘cty’ and another for ‘hwy’.\nThe barmode='group' parameter ensures that the bars are grouped for each ‘manufacturer’.\nThe update_layout method is used to set the titles for the x-axis (xaxis_title), y-axis (yaxis_title), and the overall plot (title_text). In this example, the plot represents the average city and highway mileage by manufacturer.\n\n\n\nAxis formatting - Axis Scale removing Zero\n\n\nShow the code\nfig = px.bar(data, x='manufacturer', y=['cty', 'hwy'], barmode='group')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title=\"Manufacturer\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Mileage\",\n    title_text=\"Average City and Highway Mileage by Manufacturer\",\n    xaxis=dict(showline=True, showgrid=False),\n    yaxis=dict(zeroline=False, showline=True, showgrid=False),\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis formatting - Axis Scale removing Zero Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe xaxis_title and yaxis_title parameters in the update_layout method are used to set the titles for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.\nThe xaxis and yaxis dictionaries in the update_layout method provide additional formatting options for the x-axis and y-axis. In this example:\nxaxis=dict(showline=True, showgrid=False) ensures that the x-axis has a visible line but no grid lines. yaxis=dict(zeroline=False, showline=True, showgrid=False) ensures that the y-axis has no zero line (zeroline=False), a visible line, and no grid lines. These settings help customize the appearance of the plot by controlling the visibility of axis lines and grid lines.\n\n\n\nAxis formatting - Axis Domain Sizing\n\n\nShow the code\nfig = px.bar(data, x='manufacturer', y=['cty', 'hwy'], barmode='group')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title=\"Manufacturer\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Mileage\",\n    title_text=\"Average City and Highway Mileage by Manufacturer\",\n    xaxis=dict(domain=[0.1, 0.9]),  # Adjust the domain as needed\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis formatting - Axis Domain Sizing Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe xaxis_title and yaxis_title parameters in the update_layout method are used to set the titles for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.\nThe xaxis dictionary in the update_layout method includes the domain parameter, which is set to [0.1, 0.9]. This parameter controls the size of the x-axis domain, determining the portion of the total width of the plot that the x-axis occupies. In this example, the x-axis is set to span from 10% to 90% of the total width.\nAdjust the values of the domain parameter as needed to control the sizing of the x-axis in your plot.\n\n\n\nReference marks - Verticle Reference Line with Color\n\n\nShow the code\nfig = px.bar(data, x='manufacturer', y=['cty', 'hwy'], barmode='group')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title=\"Manufacturer\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Mileage\",\n    title_text=\"Average City and Highway Mileage by Manufacturer\"\n)\n\nfig.add_shape(\n    dict(\n        type=\"line\",\n        x0=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the line\n        x1=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the line\n        y0=0,\n        y1=1,\n        line=dict(color=\"red\"),  # Specify the color of the line\n    )\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference marks - Verticle Reference Line with Color Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe add_shape method is used to add a reference line to the plot. In this example, a vertical reference line is added to the x-axis at the specified x-coordinate value.\nThe type=\"line\" parameter specifies that the added shape is a line. The x0 and x1 parameters are set to “Your_X_Value” to specify the x-coordinates where the line starts and ends. Replace “Your_X_Value” with the actual x-coordinate value where you want the reference line.\nThe y0 and y1 parameters set the starting and ending points on the y-axis. In this example, they are set to 0 and 1, respectively.\nThe line dictionary inside the shape specifies the attributes of the line, such as the color. In this case, the line color is set to red. Adjust the values as needed to customize the appearance of the reference line.\n\n\n\nReference marks - Verticle Reference Line with Text\n\n\nShow the code\nfig = px.bar(data, x='manufacturer', y=['cty', 'hwy'], barmode='group')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title=\"Manufacturer\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Mileage\",\n    title_text=\"Average City and Highway Mileage by Manufacturer\"\n)\n\nfig.add_shape(\n    dict(\n        type=\"line\",\n        x0=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the line\n        x1=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the line\n        y0=0,\n        y1=1,\n        line=dict(color=\"red\"),  # Specify the color of the line\n    )\n)\n\nfig.add_annotation(\n    text=\"Your Text\",\n    x=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the text\n    y=500,  # Adjust the y-coordinate of the text as needed\n    showarrow=False\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference marks - Verticle Reference Line with Text Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe add_shape method is used to add a reference line to the plot.

A relational database consists of tables/data sets that share columns. These shared columns then establish the relationship between the tables, thus the name relational database. The relations are sometimes not easily found and they require careful investigations.\nTo understand what is in a relational database, we can start with understanding the tables and the columns within.\nHere is a link to the readme file of the baseball database.\n\nWhat is the name of the table that records data about pitchers in the regular seasons?\n\n\nWhat do the HR and HBP columns mean in that table respectively?\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 2\n\nSELECT and FROM\nThe simplest SQL query is a query with SELECT and FROM. These are the keywords you will see again and again in SQL. Usually, when constructing a more complex query, it is easier to identify what goes into these two clauses first.\n\nCreate a query that shows all columns from the table you found in Exercise 1, save the dataframe in a variable “pitch”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nresult = pd.read_sql_query(\n    'SELECT _______ FROM _______',\n    con)\n\nresults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 3\n\nWHERE\nThe WHERE keyword allows us to filter down the table horizontally (fewer rows).\nIt goes after SELECT and FROM.\n\nUsing a SQL query, select all rows in the same table where HR is lesser than 10 and gs is greater than 25.\n\n\nFind out what the columns mean and explain your query in words\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 4\n\nORDER BY\nORDER BY sort the table you select by one or more columns and goes after WHERE\n\nUsing the same query in exercise 2, edit it so that the table is ordered by the year of the season (nearest to furthermost) and the player ID (alphabetically).\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 5\n\nJoins\nJoins are used when you wish to create a new table through two different tables. Keep in mind that you have to identify the relationship between two tables before you can correctly join them.\nJOIN goes between FROM and WHERE.\n\nIdentify the shared columns (keys) and join the table in exercise 2 with the salaries table, then filter the data so that it shows only pitchers in the year 1986.\n\nYou should get a dataframe with 306 rows.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6\n\nGroup by\nGroup by is a keyword we use to lower the level of granularity of a table. Meaning we are combining rows into one by the given column(s).\nCreate a query that captures the number of pitchers the Washington Nationals used in each year, then sort the table by year\nYou should get a dataframe with 23 rows.",

You can read the documentation of the data on this page - https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/AER/Guns.html\n\n\nExercise 1\nOne of the first things we can do to a freshly imported data is to check its columns. This will help us understand the basic structure of the dataframe(table).\n\nUsing one line of code, select all the columns in dat, assign it to a variable called col_list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery dataframe has an attribute “columns”.\nAccessing this attribute will give you a list of all column names\n\n\n\nWe often want to know the dimension of a dataframe. How many columns are in the dataset? How many rows are in the dataset?\n\nUsing one line of code, show the number of columns and rows in df.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery dataframe has an attribute “shape”.\nAccessing this attribute will give you the dimension of a datafarme\n\n\n\nNow run df.head(). It will print out the first 5 rows of data in df.\n\nJust from looking at the output, what column(s) seems to be redundant with the row number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one column that serves as nothing but a row counter, that columns is redundant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nAfter a brief investigation of the data, we will clean up the data. By cleaning up, we are trying to filter down df so this only holds data we need. We will first get rid of the extra column we found in the previous excercise.\n\nUsing one line of code, drop the redundant column using the variable col_list (created in excercise 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse drop().\nUnderstand what “axis” is as a parameter of drop().\nYour function should looks like this:\ndf.drop([col_list[_]], axis = _)\nfill the “_“’s with the correct values and assign the output to df.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save the changes in df. Run df.head() to make sure the column is dropped in df.\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nWe have filtered df vertically by dropping a column. Now we will try to filter df horizontally, meaning we will get rid of some the rows.\nWe can do that by applying a condition to df. A condition is an expression that can be evaluated as True/False. For example, 8 &gt; 5 is an expression that evaluates to be True. This is trivial because 8 will always be greater than 5.\nRun the code below:\n\nwhat is the difference between exp1 and exp2?\n\nexp1 = 8 &gt; 5\nexp2 = df.violent &lt; 300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTry type() on else variable OR calling else variable.\n\n\n\nRun ths code below:\n\nBy putting df.violent &lt; 300, and the violent column from df into a dataframe, what is the relationship between the two columns?\n\nexp = pd.DataFrame({\"df.violent &lt; 300\" : exp2,\n                    \"violent value from dat\" : df.violent})\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTry computing df.violent[n] &lt; 300 and (df.violent &lt; 300)[n] where n is less than the number of row. The two expressions will always be the same as long as n is less than the number of rows.\n\n\n\n\nUsing query()to filter down the df so that it only contains the data for idaho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nquery() takes in expressions and filters down data.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save the changes in df. Run df.shape() to make sure the there are 23 rows and 13 columns.\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nBesides filtering, we can manipulate the data by adding new data to it. By adding a new column to the data, we assign a new value to each row.\n\nUsing assign(), create a new column that show the ratio between murder rate and violent rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse assign()\nYou see get the ratio by computing this code:\ndf.murder/df.violent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\nCreate a scatter plot that shows the relationship between murder rate and violent rate for the state of Idaho. Your chart should show murder rate as the x-axis, violent as the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you mimic this plot?\nhttps://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_tooltips.html"

    "text": "Intro to Titanic Machine Learning Skill Builder\nFor this skill builder, we’ll be putting our machine learning hats on. We’ll be creating a model that predicts whether a passenger survived. With machine learning, there is a lot of jargon! It can be quite overwhelming at times. This skill builder attempts to keep things basic and simple. With that being said, there are some terms that are important to understand. Let’s look at the first few rows of our dataset before proceeding with the definitions.\nThe titanic dataset will be used for examples of each definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsurvived\npclass\nsex\nage\nsiblings_spouses_aboard\nparents_children_aboard\nfare\n\n\n\n\n0\n3\n1\n22\n1\n0\n7.25\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n38\n1\n0\n71.2833\n\n\n1\n3\n0\n26\n0\n0\n7.925\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n35\n1\n0\n53.1\n\n\n0\n3\n1\n35\n0\n0\n8.05\n\n\n\n\nImportant Terms:\n\nfeatures: measurable property of the object you’re trying to predict. We use this information to predict our target of interest.\n\nExample: pclass, sex, age, siblings_spouses_aboard , parents_children_aboard, fare columns are all examples of different features.\nSynonyms: attributes, explanatory variables, independent variables, variables, X’s, covariates\n\ntarget: the feature that you are wanting to gain more insight into. The thing you are trying to predict.\n\nExample: in the titanic dataset our target is survived\nSynonyms: label, dependent variable, y\n\ntrain set: Usually 70% of the rows from the original dataset are randomly sampled to create this training data. It’s used by the algorithm, to determine, or learn, the optimal combinations of variables that will generate a good predictive model\n\nExample: Random sample of 70% of the original titanic dataset rows\nSynonyms: training data, train data, X_train, y_train\n\ntest set: Usually the remaining 30% of the rows in the original dataset are used to create this dataset. The testing data is a set of rows used only to assess the performance (i.e. generalization) of a model. To do this, the final model is used to predict classifications of examples in the test set. Those predictions are compared to the examples’ true classifications to assess the model’s accuracy.\n\nExample: Random sample of 30% of the original titanic dataset rows\nSynonyms: testing data, test data, X_test, y_test\n\nevaluation metrics: A statistic that tells you how well your predictions align with the actual values. Other words, tells you how good your model is.\n\nExample: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, MSE, MAE, Rsquared\nSynonyms: performance metric\n\n\nAgain, this is a very light and oversimplified treatment of machine learning. The purpose of this project is to help you understand the main concepts of ml and walk you through the process of building a machine learning model. A simplified work flow of a machine learning project is shown below. Spend some time getting familiar with this flow &mdash as you are about to code it… Exciting!\nNote in order to do this skill builder you will need to have scikit-learn installed on your machine. Run the following command in your terminal if you haven’t already.\npip install scikit-learn\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\nImports and Loading in Data\n# Loading in packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Loading in data\ndata = pd.read_csv(___)\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nCreate a chart exploring the relationship between age and survived in the titanic dataset. A strip plot, density plot, or boxplot might be useful here. Below is an example of a density plot. Feel free to replicate this chart or create your own.\nThe purpose of making this chart is to explore the relationships between a feature and the target. We want to see if the feature contains predictive information about the target. This is a large part of machine learning called Exploratory Data Analysis that should never be skipped! Spend time getting to know your features and how they interact with other features and the target.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nBuild a random forest model that is able to predict whether a passenger survived. This exercise is the bulk of the skill builder and contains several steps.\n\nStep 0: Split the data into X and y variables\nThe X variable will contain all your features\n# Removes the target and keeps all features\nX = data.drop(___, axis=1)  \nThe y variable will hold the target\n# Selects the target column\ny = data['___']  \n\n\nStep 1: Split data into train and test sets\nThe train_test_split function is useful for this task. Review the train_test_split function documentation\n# Splitting X and y variables into train and test sets using stratified sampling\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(___, ___, test_size=0.3,\n                                                    random_state=24, stratify=y)\n\n\nStep 2: Train the model\nExplore the RandomForestClassifier documentation for the RandomForestClassifier. It’s not necessary to understand the inner workings of the Random Forest algorithm for this class - just learn the syntax of fitting the model.\n# Creating random forest object\nrf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=24)  \n\n# Fit with the training data\nrf.fit(___, ___)  \n\n\nStep 3: Use test set to make predictions\n# Using the features in the test set to make predictions\ny_pred = rf.predict(___)  \n\n\nStep 4: Compare test set predictions to actual values. Calculate the accuracy.\n# Comparing predictions to actual values\naccuracy_score(___, ___)  \n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nWhat is the most important feature in making predictions? Why do you think this is?\nCreate a table that shows the feature importances in descending order. The random forest classifier has a feature importances attribute. It can be accessed by rf.feature_importances_. The table should look something like this.\n\n\n\nfeature names\nimportances\n\n\n\n\nfare\n0.288051\n\n\nsex\n0.281853\n\n\nage\n0.266491\n\n\npclass\n0.0814224\n\n\nsiblings_spouses_aboard\n0.0475633\n\n\nparents_children_aboard\n0.034619\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have completed this skill builder with your team (or on your own) then compare your work to our script\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the script.",

Programming will be extremely frustrating if we are not allowed to do web searches, so please get familiar with the tools you have and use them often.\n\n\n\nOffical Documentation\nThis should be your first resort for understanding any code/function.

This is another very useful resource since this is designed for this class. link to the textbook: https://byuidatascience.github.io/python4ds/\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nLocate the section where the textbook talks about query() and answer these questions.\n\nWhat function in R’s dplyr is equivalent or comparable to query() in pandas (You should include the section number in your answer)?\nWhat is the easiest mistake for python beginner to make that was shown in the text about query() (You should include the section number in your answer)?\n\n\nThe Internet\nGoogle is a programmer’s friend. Get used to googling thing, in fact, you want to be an expert in googling\n\nQuestion that cannot be answered by the textbook and documentation? Google it.\n\nA function you have never seen before? Google it.\nAn error in your code? Google it.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nProvide at least 2 extra resources you could find about the pandas function drop() on the internet.\n\nTutor, TA (Through Slack, Zoom, or In-Person)\nWe want to help you with your work; we want to answer your questions; but most importantly, we want to help you succeed in this class. That will require you to put in the necessary time in understanding the readings, coding and debugging. When you ask us a question, we expect that you have read the documentation, searched the textbook, and done your own research. Then we can be most helpful and can provide insights on top of your understanding.\n\n\nExamples of Bad Questions\n\nHow does drop() work? We will ask you to read the documentation for drop().\nHow do you make a table in a markdown file? We will refer you to the textbook.\nI don’t want these columns in my data, how can I drop them? We will ask you if you have found any things on the internet.\n\n\n\nExamples of good questions\n\nI am still confused about the syntax of drop(). After reading the documentation, this is my understanding of the function… . What am I missing?\nI tried making a table in markdown (show code), it is still not giving me what I want, how can I fix this?\nI am trying to drop these columns in my dataframe, I think drop() is what I am looking for. Am I in the right direction? If not, what keywords should I be googling?\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nUsing the code and tools mentioned above, finish question 4 and 5 under 3.2.4 in the textbook.(use the data in mpg for your plot):\n# library import\nimport pandas as pd \nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# data import\nurl = \"https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/raw/master/data-raw/mpg/mpg.csv\"\n\nmpg = pd.read_csv(url)\n\nQuestion 4: Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.\nQuestion 5: What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have completed this skill builder with your team (or on your own) then compare your work to our script\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the script.",

Assuming we have already installed the altair library, we need to install the altair_saver.\n\n1.1 Installing the altair_saver\nWithin your interactive python window execute the following command.\nimport sys\n!{sys.executable} -m pip install altair_saver\n\n\n1.2 Additional tool for saving plots\nWe suggest NodeJS path. However, you are more than welcome to study Selenium for further understanding. The Github repository for altair_saver, the developers exclusively told us to install additional tools.\n\n\n1.3 Saving a plot using altair_saver\nIt might require you to restart VScode and import everything again for this to work. Please note that the plot will be saved in the same folder of the script.\nchart = alt.chart(&lt;data&gt;).&lt;chart_methods&gt;\nchart.save('name_of_chart.png')\n\n\n\n2. Save as PNG method\nThe method only requires us to have Altair library. Whenever we output a plot, we will see a button with three dots at the top right corner of the plot.\n\n\n\nClicking Save as PNG will bring us to a window to save our plot.\n\n\nClicking Save as PNG will bring us to a window to save our plot.\n\n\n3.

Even when the data is recorded cleanly the options for ‘write in questions’, ‘choose from multiple answers’, ‘pick all that are right’, and ‘multiple choice questions’ makes storing the data in a tidy format difficult.\nIn 2014, FiveThirtyEight surveyed over 1000 people to write the article titled, America’s Favorite ‘Star Wars’ Movies (And Least Favorite Characters). They have provided the data on GitHub.\nFor this project, your client would like to use the Star Wars survey data to figure out if they can predict an interviewing job candidate’s current income based on a few responses about Star Wars movies.\n\n\nClient Request\nThe Client is who performed the survey but outsourced the analitics to a 3rd party.

But a relationship is simply a way to describe how two or more objects are connected. There are many relationships in baseball such as those between teams and managers, players and salaries, even stadiums and concession prices.\nThe graphs on Data Visualizations from Best Tickets show many other relationships that exist in baseball.\n\n\nClient Request\nFor this project, the Client wants SQL queries that they can use to retrieve data for use on their website without needing Python.

The new table should contain five columns: playerID, schoolID, salary, and the yearID/teamID associated with each salary. Order the table by salary (highest to lowest) and print out the table in your report.\nThis three-part question requires you to calculate batting average (number of hits divided by the number of at-bats)\n\nWrite an SQL query that provides playerID, yearID, and batting average for players with at least 1 at bat that year. Sort the table from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report.\n\nUse the same query as above, but only include players with at least 10 at bats that year. Print the top 5 results.\n\nNow calculate the batting average for players over their entire careers (all years combined). Only include players with at least 100 at bats, and print the top 5 results.\n\nPick any two baseball teams and compare them using a metric of your choice (average salary, home runs, number of wins, etc). Write an SQL query to get the data you need, then make a graph using Plotly Express to visualize the comparison.

You must comment in Canvas when submitting your project if you completed any of the Stretch questions.\n\nAdvanced Salary Distribution by Position (with Case Statement):\n\nWrite an SQL query that provides a summary table showing the average salary for players in each position (e.g., pitcher, catcher, outfielder) across all years. Include the following columns:\n\nposition\naverage_salary\ntotal_players\nhighest_salary\n\nThe highest_salary column should display the highest salary ever earned by a player in that position. If no player in that position has a recorded salary, display “N/A” for the highest salary.\nAdditionally, create a new column called salary_category using a case statement:\n\nIf the average salary is above $1 million, categorize it as “High Salary.”\n\nIf the average salary is between $500,000 and $1 million, categorize it as “Medium Salary.”\n\nOtherwise, categorize it as “Low Salary.”\n\nOrder the table by average salary in descending order.\nPrint the top 10 rows of this summary table.\n\nAdvanced Career Longevity and Performance (with Subqueries):\n\nCalculate the average career length (in years) for players who have played at least one game. Then, identify the top 10 players with the longest careers (based on the number of years they played). Include their:\n\nplayerID\nfirst_name\nlast_name\ncareer_length\n\nThe career_length should be calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum yearID for each player.\n\n\n\n\nDeliverables\nUse this template to submit your Client Report.

On average, a student will spend 2 hours outside of class per hour in class to complete the assigned readings, submit any Canvas items, and complete the project (for a total of 8 hours per project). The instruction for each project will be structured into sections as written on this page.\nThis first Background section provides context for the project. Make sure you read the background carefully to see the big picture needs and purpose of the project.\n\n\n\nEarly in prehistory, some descriptive names began to be used again and again until they formed a name pool for a particular culture. Parents would choose names from the pool of existing names rather than invent new ones for their children.\nWith the rise of Christianity, certain trends in naming practices manifested. Christians were encouraged to name their children after saints and martyrs of the church. These early Christian names can be found in many cultures today, in various forms. These were spread by early missionaries throughout the Mediterranean basin and Europe.\nBy the Middle Ages, the Christian influence on naming practices was pervasive. Each culture had its pool of names, which were a combination of native names and early Christian names that had been in the language long enough to be considered native. [ref]\n\n\nClient Request\nThis csv file contains the number of times a name was given to a child in a specific year. The Client has a passion for names throughout history. They would like to know how the usage of names has changed over time. They are particularly interested in the names Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul. They would also like to know how the usage of a name from a famous movie has changed over time.\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery data science project should start with data, and our class projects are no different.

Core questions are required for each project. The course syllabus competencies requires specic a number of projects having all the Stretch questions achived based on your goals for the grade level you are seeking.\n\n\n\nFor Project 1 the answer to each question should include a chart and a written response.

    "text": "Introduction\n\n“The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device.” — John Tukey\n\nThis chapter introudces data visualization with the Plotly Express library. We briefly discus the grammar of graphics which is a useful paradigm for understanding the fundamentals of building graphs. Then we introudce the basics of Plotly Express and provide resources for further development.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nPlotly Express Install\nFor a slightly more interesting introduction, let’s look at the classic iris dataset built into the plotly.express data library. This dataset contains measurements on 3 species of irises.\nFirst, load the data by calling .data from the px library as follows:\n\nimport plotly.express as px\ndata = px.data.iris()\ndata.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal_length\nsepal_width\npetal_length\npetal_width\nspecies\nspecies_id\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore the relationship between sepal width and sepal length, we can start with a basic scatterplot.\n\npx.scatter(data,  x=\"sepal_width\", y=\"sepal_length\", title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\")\n\n                                                \n\n\nWhen all species are lumped together in this scatterplot it doesn’t look like there is much of a relationship between the sepal width and sepal length. We can improve our visualiztion by coloring the points based on species.\n\npx.scatter(data,  x=\"sepal_width\", y=\"sepal_length\", color = \"species\", title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\")\n\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages/plotly/express/_core.py:2065: FutureWarning:\n\nWhen grouping with a length-1 list-like, you will need to pass a length-1 tuple to get_group in a future version of pandas. Pass `(name,)` instead of `name` to silence this warning.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nNotice that px has default hover labels related to x, y, and color. If we would like to modify what information is displayed when we hover over a point, we can add a “hover_data” option.\n\npx.scatter(data,  x=\"sepal_width\", y=\"sepal_length\", color = \"species\", hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\")\n\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages/plotly/express/_core.py:2065: FutureWarning:\n\nWhen grouping with a length-1 list-like, you will need to pass a length-1 tuple to get_group in a future version of pandas. Pass `(name,)` instead of `name` to silence this warning.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nAs we increase the complexity of a visualization, our code starts to become less readable. Readable code is a magnificent skill to master. So a better way to express the same code as above is:\n\npx.scatter(data,\n    x=\"sepal_width\", \n    y=\"sepal_length\", \n    color = \"species\", \n    hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], \n    title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\"\n)\n\n/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages/plotly/express/_core.py:2065: FutureWarning:\n\nWhen grouping with a length-1 list-like, you will need to pass a length-1 tuple to get_group in a future version of pandas. Pass `(name,)` instead of `name` to silence this warning.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nWe can also easily change the shape and size of the points in a scatterplot.\n\npx.scatter(data,\n    x=\"sepal_width\", \n    y=\"sepal_length\", \n    color = \"species\", \n    size = \"petal_length\",\n    symbol = \"species\",\n    hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], \n    title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\"\n)\n\n                                                \n\n\nNow that’s just silly! But hopefully the basic syntax for using px makes sense.\n\n\nMaking Plotly.Express More Presentable\nIn this section, we look at how to customize charts to be more informative and presentable. For example, column names in a dataset are rarely a good idea to present to someone not as intimately familiar with the data as you. We may also wish to highlight certain points, or draw attention to areas on a graph.\nTo begin, let’s return to a reasonable visualization of the iris data. We will start by naming our px chart object “fig” and changing the X and Y axis labels.\nThere are 2 ways to change labels. The more direct way is to include a “labels” dictionary in the figure inputs. The key-value pairs in this list are first, the variable name, and second, the desired label.\n\nfig = px.scatter(data,\n    x=\"sepal_width\", \n    y=\"sepal_length\", \n    color = \"species\", \n    symbol = \"species\",\n    labels={\"sepal_width\": \"Sepal Width\", \"sepal_length\": \"Sepal Length\", \"species\": \"Species\"},\n    hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], \n    title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\"\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe next method makes the same adjustments but modifies the chart “post hoc”. Start with a very basic chart, “fig” and use the .update.layout() method to modify titles.\n\nfig = px.scatter(data,\n    x=\"sepal_width\", \n    y=\"sepal_length\", \n    color = \"species\", \n    symbol = \"species\",\n    hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], \n    title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\"\n)\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title = \"Sepal Width\",\n    yaxis_title = \"Sepal Length\",\n    legend_title = \"Species\"\n)\n\n                                                \n\n\n The 2 approaches above have the same outcome, but the latter example introduces a flexible px paradigm that can be extended to other chart additions and modifications. For example, if we want to add a reference line to “fig”, we can use the .add_hline() method. \n\nfig.add_hline(\n    y = 7,\n    line_dash = \"dot\",\n    line_color = \"black\"\n)\n\n                                                \n\n\nWe can add several different shapes, including circles, lines or rectanges using the .add_shape() method. This method specifies what type of shape to add to the graph given a set of coordinates (x0, x1, y0, y1). “.add_shape()” can be used to draw reference lines as well, but still requires a all 4 coordinates.\n\n# Adds a horizontal line\nfig.add_shape(\n    type = \"circle\",\n    line_color = \"green\",\n    line_width = 3,\n    line_dash = \"dot\",\n    opacity = 1,\n    x0 = 3.7, x1=3.9,\n    y0=7.6,y1=8\n)\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe code above introduces many of the .add_shape() features all at once, not all of which are necessary for every situation. But hopefully this gives a flavor of what can be done.\nNotice also, that the .add_ methods actually update fig. No need to overwrite the original object or create a new chart object for each modification.\n\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nOther .add_itions\nThere are several other useful “post hoc” graph modifications that we only mention in this chapter. For further exploration, see Plotly Express Styling.\nUse fig.add_annotation() to add text with or without arrows pointing to specific locations. Update axes by using fig.update_yaxes() or fig.update_xaxes which allows you to modify gridlines and add units of measure like “%” or “$”. .add_vrect() and add_hrect() allow you to highlight regions vertically or horizontally. The possibilities are almost endless!\n\n\nResources\nThis chapter has introudced the basics of plotly.express, but we have only looked at a scatterplot. For links to further documentation and a whole gallery of px possibilities, see Plotly Express in Python.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

On average, a student will spend 2 hours outside of class per hour in class to complete the assigned readings, submit any Canvas items, and complete the project (for a total of 8 hours per project). The instruction for each project will be structured into sections as written on this page.\nThis first Background section provides context for the project. Make sure you read the background carefully to see the big picture needs and purpose of the project.\n\n\n\nDelayed flights are not something most people look forward to. In the best case scenario you may only wait a few extra minutes for the plane to be cleaned. However, those few minutes can stretch into hours if a mechanical issue is discovered or a storm develops. Arriving hours late may result in you missing a connecting flight, job interview, or your best friend’s wedding.\nIn 2003 the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) began collecting data on the causes of delayed flights. The categories they use are Air Carrier, National Aviation System, Weather, Late-Arriving Aircraft, and Security. You can visit the BTS website to read definitions of these categories.\n\n\nClient Request\nThe JSON file for this project contains information on delays at 7 airports over 10 years. Your task is to clean the data, search for insights about flight delays, and communicate your results to the Client. The Client is a CEO of a flight booking app who is interested in the causes of flight delays and wants to know which airports have the worst delays. They also want to know the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length.\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery data science project should start with data, and our class projects are no different. Each project will have ‘Download’ and ‘Information’ links like the ones below.\n\n\n\nDownload: JSON File\nInformation: Data Description\nSubject Matter: Types of Delay\n\n\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Readings section will contain links to reading assignments that are required for each project, as well as optional references. Remember that you are reading this material to build skills. Take the time to comprehend the readings and the skills contained within.\nWe recommend reading through the assigned material once for a general understanding before the first day of each project. You will reread and reference the material multiple times as you complete the project.\n\n\n\n\nP4DS: Section 12.1 & 12.2 Tidy data\nP4DS: Chapter 5 Data transformation\nP4DS: Section 7.4 Missing Values\nPython Data Science Handbook: Missing Data\nHandling Missing Data\nWikipedia Missing Data\n\n\nOptional References\n\nisin method\nwhere method\nnp.where method\nreplace method\nAn introduction to JSON (May need to open in ingognito to read.)\nThe key word in ‘Data Science’ is not Data…\nHow to Handle Missing Data (May need to open in ingognito to read.)\nLambda Function\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Tasks (Core)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section lists the questions and tasks that need to be completed for the project. Your work on the project must be compiled into a report, pushed to GitHub and a URL submitted in Canvas by the weekend following the last day of material for the project.\nThere are two types of questions: Core and Stretch. Core questions are required for each project. The course syllabus competencies requires specic a number of projects having all the Stretch questions achived based on your goals for the grade level you are seeking.\n\n\n\n\nFix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”). In your report include one record example (one row) from your new data, in the raw JSON format. Your example should display the “NaN” for at least one missing value.__\nWhich airport has the worst delays? Describe the metric you chose, and why you chose it to determine the “worst” airport. Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours.\nWhat is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length? Describe the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month. (To answer this question, you will need to remove any rows that are missing the Month variable.)\nAccording to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:\n\n100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather\n\n30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather\n\nFrom April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%\n\nUsing the new weather variable calculated above, create a barplot showing the proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport. Describe what you learn from this graph.\n\n\n\nQuestions and Tasks (Stretch)\nHere is an example Stretch question(s) for this project. Your instructor may assign different Stretch question(s). You must comment in Canvas when submitting your project if you completed any of the Stretch questions.\n\nWhich delay is the worst delay? Create a similar analysis as above for Weahter Delay with: Carrier Delay and Security Delay. Compare the proportion of delay for each of the three categories in a Chart and a Table. Describe your results.\n\n\n\nDeliverables\nUse this template to submit your Client Report. The template has two sections:\n\nA short elevator pitch that highlights key values or metrics from the results. Describing these key insights to interest or hook the reader to want to read more about your work. The writing style should be more technical with some creative elements. Do not summarize what you did.\n\nAnswers to the questions | tasks. Each answer should include a written description of your results, code cells with comments, charts, and/or tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nYour report should be written in quarto markdown files and pushed to GitHub which will render it to HTML.

It has also morphed into a tool to house all your work in a portfolio. Think about an Art student and how they have to develop their portfolio of various skills they have across the art classes. Similarly you will want to showcase you skillset across the Data Science skillsets.\nAs students, you will want to curate your creative work on GitHub using a program called Git. GitHub is the place to share your original work, not your homework assignments. The reading assignments will dive deaper into what to include in your portfolio and what not to include.\nMany people store their personal websites, blogs, and project websites on GitHub. Our textbook and course are hosted on GitHub, and you can see J. Hathaway’s or Ryan Hafen’s personal Data Science websites that are hosted on GitHub as well.\nFor this project, you will be making a public website that is a data science portfolio that will be hosted on GitHub.

We accomplish this by either one hot encoding, label encoding, or taking just one value of the range provided. There are many other ways to represent these columns as numbers, but they are beyond the scope of this course.\nOnce you’ve converted all columns to numeric, in an intelligent way, you will be asked to recreate a graph using plotly express.

By cleaning up, we are trying to filter down df so this only holds data we need. We will first get rid of the extra column we found in the previous excercise.\n\nUsing one line of code, drop the redundant column using the variable col_list (created in excercise 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse drop().\nUnderstand what “axis” is as a parameter of drop().\nYour function should looks like this:\ndf.drop([col_list[_]], axis = _)\nfill the “_“’s with the correct values and assign the output to df.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save the changes in df. Run df.head() to make sure the column is dropped in df.\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nWe have filtered df vertically by dropping a column. Now we will try to filter df horizontally, meaning we will get rid of some the rows.\nWe can do that by applying a condition to df. A condition is an expression that can be evaluated as True/False. For example, 8 &gt; 5 is an expression that evaluates to be True. This is trivial because 8 will always be greater than 5.\nRun the code below:\n\nwhat is the difference between exp1 and exp2?\n\nexp1 = 8 &gt; 5\nexp2 = df.violent &lt; 300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTry type() on else variable OR calling else variable.\n\n\n\nRun ths code below:\n\nBy putting df.violent &lt; 300, and the violent column from df into a dataframe, what is the relationship between the two columns?\n\nexp = pd.DataFrame({\"df.violent &lt; 300\" : exp2,\n                    \"violent value from dat\" : df.violent})\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTry computing df.violent[n] &lt; 300 and (df.violent &lt; 300)[n] where n is less than the number of row. The two expressions will always be the same as long as n is less than the number of rows.\n\n\n\n\nUsing query()to filter down the df so that it only contains the data for idaho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nquery() takes in expressions and filters down data.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save the changes in df. Run df.shape() to make sure the there are 23 rows and 13 columns.\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nBesides filtering, we can manipulate the data by adding new data to it. By adding a new column to the data, we assign a new value to each row.\n\nUsing assign(), create a new column that show the ratio between murder rate and violent rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse assign()\nYou see get the ratio by computing this code:\ndf.murder/df.violent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\nCreate a scatter plot that shows the relationship between murder rate and violent rate for the state of Idaho. Your chart should show murder rate as the x-axis, violent as the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you mimic this plot while using Plotly-Express?\nhttps://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_tooltips.html https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/",

There is a draft submission due Wednesday (W) of the 2nd week of the project and the final draft due the following Saturday (S). This gives you two attempts to get full points on the project. There are 6 two-week projects (P0-P5) and 1 one-week project (P6).\n\nGrading Details\n\n1 point: Submission\n3 points: Submission of a good faith attempt with a statement of work quality.\n4 points: High-quality work that addresses each of the Questions and Tasks and a comment in Canvas of your statement of work quality.\n5 points: Addressed issues and completion of resubmission (if needed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoints (methods and calculations)\nThese checkpoints are in Canvas and they open when the project starts. They have unlimited attempts and remain open until the end of the semester.\n\nExamples\n\nFact-Finding Questions (Calculate descriptive summaries): Fact-finding questions help you with calculations that build into the Questions and Tasks of the project. These questions have clearly defined answers using Python calculations. You should expect 2-3 problems.\n\n\nExample: Using the top 10 airports in size, what is the average size?\nExample: What proportion of flights are delayed at the largest airport?\n\n\nHow the code works questions (Explaining the tools): This part could have direct answer questions or open-ended questions.\n\n\nExample (direct): What is the recommended function for arranging your data by a variable? What are the outputs after using &lt;FUNCTION&gt;?\nExample (open): Your client has shown some confusion about NumPy’s ‘nan’ handling in Python. Help them understand by answering the question, ‘How is missing data handled in Pandas?’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoints (Mid-project status)\nThe mid-project checkpoint has a few questions. It opens the first day of the project and closes at 1 am on the 3rd day of class for the project. It has the following questions.\n\nExamples\n\nHave you checked off more than one grand question from the current project? (Yes/No)\nHave you spent at least 2 hours using code to tackle problems related to the case study? (Yes/No).\nHave you prepared questions you have about the case study to ask in your next meeting? (Yes/No).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science Community\nTo earn credit for the DS Community element you must complete tasks from the list below. At the end of the semester, you will be asked to report on which tasks you completed and what you learned from them. See the Competency Scale above to determine how many you need to complete based on the grade you want.\n\nAttend Data Science Society at least once.\nSign up for an email newsletter that will teach you more about data science. Data Science Weekly or Data Elixir are good options.\nListen to a podcast episode about data science. Build a Career in Data Science has some excellent episodes.\nWatch a professional presentation on YouTube about data science. Be prepared to share the link and a summary of the video.\nReach out to someone who works in a data-related field and ask them for 15 minutes of their time. Use this time to conduct an “informational interview” and learn more about their responsibilities and career path.\nResearch and apply to at least 5 data-related jobs or internships.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinishing the semester\nSubmit a Course Goals Letter (End) that includes what you have learned from this class, the next data science course you plan on taking, and the final grade that you are requesting based on the work you have submitted compared to the competencies above.\n\n\n\n\nCoding challenge\nWe will have an in-class coding challenge on the ultimate or penultimate day of class. It would be best if you did not view this challenge like a traditional exam. It will cover the general techniques that we have been practicing throughout the course.\nWe expect to have a few practice challenges throughout the semester. We will score the coding challenge on a four-point scale.\n\n1 point: At least you tried.\n2 points: You have learned some items from the course, but your work in the coding challenge is deficient.\n3 points: Your submission uses proper coding techniques and addresses the objective.\n4 points: Exceptional work. Your code can be used as a solution to share with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

As students, you will want to curate your creative work on GitHub using a program called Git. GitHub is the place to share your original work, not your homework assignments.\nMany people store their personal websites, blogs, and project websites on GitHub. Our textbook and course are hosted on GitHub, and you can see J. Hathaway’s or Ryan Hafen’s personal Data Science websites that are hosted on GitHub as well. For this project, you will be making a public resume that will be hosted on GitHub.\nDuring this project you will learn the process of Git and the tools of GitHub. We will use Git to have others in our class to edit your resume. Take the process seriously (pick a suitable username and write a good resume), and you will have the beginning of your social presence in the DS/CS space.\n\n\nData\nRepository: Markdown Resume (mdresume) Repository\nInformation: BYUI Data Science Resumes\n\n\nReadings\n\nNew to Git and GitHub?

On average, a student will spend 2 hours outside of class per hour in class to complete the assigned readings, submit any Canvas items, and complete the project (for a total of 8 hours per project). The instruction for each project will be structured into sections as written on this page.\nThis first Background section provides context for the project. Make sure you read the background carefully to see the big picture needs and purpose of the project.\n\n\nPython and VS Code are tools commonly used in the field of data science. During our first two days of class we will get VS Code prepped for data science programming. Completing Project 0 will set you up for success the rest of the semester.\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEvery data science project should start with data, and our class projects are no different. Each project will have ‘Download’ and ‘Information’ links like the ones below.\n\n\nDownload: mpg data\nInformation: Data description\n\n\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Readings section will contain links to reading assignments that are required for each project, as well as optional references. Remember that you are reading this material to build skills. Take the time to comprehend the readings and the skills contained within.\nWe recommend reading through the assigned material once for a general understanding before the first day of each project. You will reread and reference the material multiple times as you complete the project.\n\n\nThe readings listed below are required for the first two days of class.\n\nCourse Setup\nLearn about VS Code\nLearn about Plotly Express\nLearn about our Book Python for Data Science\nQuarto Instructional Template for DS\nPython for Data Science (P4DS): Introduction\n\n\nOptional References\n\nVS Code user interface\nReading Technical Documentation\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Tasks:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis section lists the questions and tasks that need to be completed for the project. Your work on the project must be compiled into a report and submitted in Canvas by the weekend following the last day of material for the project.\n\n\n\nFinish the readings and be prepared with any questions to get your environment working smoothly (class for on-campus and Slack for online)\nIn VS Code, write a python script to create the example chart from section 3.2.2 of the textbook (part of the assigned readings). Note that you will be using Plotly Express to display the chart instead of Altair which is used in the book.\nYour final report should also include the markdown table created from the following (assuming you have mpg from question 2).\n\n(mpg\n  .head(5)\n  .filter([\"manufacturer\", \"model\",\"year\", \"hwy\"])\n)\n\n\nDeliverables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDeliverables are “the quantifiable goods or services that must be provided upon the completion of a project”. In this class the deliverable for each project is a HTML report created using Quarto. This final section will be the same for each project.\n\n\nUse this template to submit your Client Report. The template has two sections:\n\nA short elevator pitch that highlights key values or metrics from the results. Describing these key insights to interest or hook the reader to want to read more about your work. The writing style should be more technical with some creative elements. Do not summarize what you did.\nAnswers to the questions | tasks. Each answer should include a written description of your results, code cells with comments, charts, and/or tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

It is a declarative visualization package in Python that is based on Vega-Lite which leverages the grammar of graphics.\n\nUser Guide\nData Visualization Curriculum or the Quarto version\nP4DS Data Visualization Chapter\n\n\n\nRendering Altair Charts in Quarto\nWe use Quarto to render Altair images automagically into our HTML reports. The process should simply work. If not, read in the following section if you need to export one of your images as a .png or another image format.\n\n\nBelow are backup methods if Quarto is not working to render Altair Charts\n\n\nRendering Altair Charts for Win 10/11 and Intel-Mac (NodeJS Installation)\n\nInstall the NodeJS for your platform\nRun the following in your Terminal (Intel-Mac) or PowerShell (Windows) to install all the packages we need from NodeJS.\n\nnpm install -g vega-lite vega-cli canvas\n\n\n\nRendering Altair Charts for M1/M2 Mac\n\nInstall selenium using the chromedriver package form this link: https://chromedriver.chromium.org.\nUnzip the file and move the file to your chrome path /usr/local/bin/chromedriver\n\nSee the selenium_fix.py script for an example.\nNote: This process will run a local server on your computer that opens the chart as an PNG file in chrome and downloads the file to the folder in which that VSCode file is located on your computer.\n\n\nSaving Altair Charts (not needed with Quarto - reference only)\nJust installing altair and altair_saver will not allow you to leverage the .save() method to save your chart. The javascript visualization you see in your interactive python window needs additional external applications to allow .save('chart.png') to work.\nWe will go through a few ways for us to save our Altair plots.\n\n\n\n1. Saving altair plots programmatically\n\n\n\nabove plot to be saved\n\n\nLet’s say we want to save the above plot as a PNG file. Assuming we have already installed the altair library, we need to install the altair_saver.\n\n1.1 Installing the altair_saver\nWithin your interactive python window execute the following command.\nimport sys\n!{sys.executable} -m pip install altair_saver\n\n\n1.2 Additional tool for saving plots\nWe suggest NodeJS path. However, you are more than welcome to study Selenium for further understanding. The Github repository for altair_saver, the developers exclusively told us to install additional tools.\n\n\n1.3 Saving a plot using altair_saver\nIt might require you to restart VScode and import everything again for this to work. Please note that the plot will be saved in the same folder of the script.\nchart = alt.chart(&lt;data&gt;).&lt;chart_methods&gt;\nchart.save('name_of_chart.png')\n\n\n\n2. Save as PNG method\nThe method only requires us to have Altair library. Whenever we output a plot, we will see a button with three dots at the top right corner of the plot.\n\n\n\nClicking Save as PNG will bring us to a window to save our plot.\n\n\nClicking Save as PNG will bring us to a window to save our plot.\n\n\n3. Screenshot method\nIf all thing fails and we need to save a plot, the snip & sketch (Windows) or taking a screenshot (MacOS) will be our last resort.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
