    "text": "“What do you mean by data science programming?”\nMost likely, you have had 1-2 courses of programming before you have taken DS 250. Unlike traditional computer science courses, DS 250 uses Python in an interactive mode instead of building programs. The data provider usually has some big questions that need answering; However, there are hundreds of little issues and responses along the way. We use programming to facilitate this investigation.\nThere are similarities with User Experience Designers. In our case, we don’t get to ask users about their experience. We use programming to ask data about its background, and each data set has its own history. We want our analysis to mold to that experience. You can think of data science programming like a first date with your data. You can’t write one long program nieve of the issues and nuances each living data set provides.\n\n\n\n“How does DS 250 compare to DS 350?”\nThe two courses have similarities. You could think of DS 250 as an introduction to data wrangling and visualization. Both classes use real-world data and are built around data science projects. There are some critical differences between the two courses.\n\nIn this course, we use Python, and DS 350 uses R.\nWe are introducing the principles of data science programming in DS 250.\nThe course is only 2-credits.\nDS 250 is intended to introduce visualization, wrangling, and modeling.\n\n\n\n\nfaq “How does DS 250 prepare me for DS 350 and CSE 450?”\nYou will be comfortable with interactive programming and have an introduction to the principles of data formats for data science applications. You will be introduced to principles related to machine learning, data wrangling, and data visualization.\n\n\n\n“What programming languages do we use in this course?”\nThe course is done using Python. We focus on the pandas and Altair packages.\n\n\n\n“What are the prerequisites for this course?”\nUsing the new courses at BYU-I, the prerequisite is CSE 110. However, if you have experience programming from other classes, you most likely are prepared for this course.\n\n\n\n“Why Python instead of R?”\nThe computer science and software engineering programs at BYU-I use Python as their foundational courses. The standard student will have some experience with Python before DS 250. Python is an essential programming language for data scientists, and we already have DS350, which is taught in R.\n\n\n\n“What is pandas?”\npandas is the foundational data science package in Python. If you are using tabular data you will be in pandas.\n\n\n\n“Why are we using Altair instead of Seaborn or Matplotlib?”\nMatplotlib was the first visualization package to gain a following in Python. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib. Many data scientists use both in their work—neither leverage the grammar of graphics as developed by Leland Wilkinson. Altair is built on Vega-Lite, which uses the Vega visualization grammar. It is declarative and actively developed. We expect that it will become the predominant visualization package in Python https://youtu.be/FytuB8nFHPQ and https://youtu.be/vTingdk_pVM.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The y parameter is set to a list [‘cty’, ‘hwy’], indicating that two sets of bars will be plotted for each manufacturer, one for ‘cty’ and another for ‘hwy’.\nThe barmode='group' parameter ensures that the bars are grouped for each ‘manufacturer’.\nThe update_layout method is used to set the titles for the x-axis (xaxis_title), y-axis (yaxis_title), and the overall plot (title_text). In this example, the plot represents the average city and highway mileage by manufacturer.\n\n\n\nAxis formatting - Axis Scale removing Zero\n\n\nShow the code\nfig = px.bar(data, x='manufacturer', y=['cty', 'hwy'], barmode='group')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title=\"Manufacturer\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Mileage\",\n    title_text=\"Average City and Highway Mileage by Manufacturer\",\n    xaxis=dict(showline=True, showgrid=False),\n    yaxis=dict(zeroline=False, showline=True, showgrid=False),\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis formatting - Axis Scale removing Zero Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe xaxis_title and yaxis_title parameters in the update_layout method are used to set the titles for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.\nThe xaxis and yaxis dictionaries in the update_layout method provide additional formatting options for the x-axis and y-axis. In this example:\nxaxis=dict(showline=True, showgrid=False) ensures that the x-axis has a visible line but no grid lines. yaxis=dict(zeroline=False, showline=True, showgrid=False) ensures that the y-axis has no zero line (zeroline=False), a visible line, and no grid lines. These settings help customize the appearance of the plot by controlling the visibility of axis lines and grid lines.\n\n\n\nAxis formatting - Axis Domain Sizing\n\n\nShow the code\nfig = px.bar(data, x='manufacturer', y=['cty', 'hwy'], barmode='group')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title=\"Manufacturer\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Mileage\",\n    title_text=\"Average City and Highway Mileage by Manufacturer\",\n    xaxis=dict(domain=[0.1, 0.9]),  # Adjust the domain as needed\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis formatting - Axis Domain Sizing Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe xaxis_title and yaxis_title parameters in the update_layout method are used to set the titles for the x-axis and y-axis, respectively.\nThe xaxis dictionary in the update_layout method includes the domain parameter, which is set to [0.1, 0.9]. This parameter controls the size of the x-axis domain, determining the portion of the total width of the plot that the x-axis occupies. In this example, the x-axis is set to span from 10% to 90% of the total width.\nAdjust the values of the domain parameter as needed to control the sizing of the x-axis in your plot.\n\n\n\nReference marks - Verticle Reference Line with Color\n\n\nShow the code\nfig = px.bar(data, x='manufacturer', y=['cty', 'hwy'], barmode='group')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title=\"Manufacturer\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Mileage\",\n    title_text=\"Average City and Highway Mileage by Manufacturer\"\n)\n\nfig.add_shape(\n    dict(\n        type=\"line\",\n        x0=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the line\n        x1=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the line\n        y0=0,\n        y1=1,\n        line=dict(color=\"red\"),  # Specify the color of the line\n    )\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference marks - Verticle Reference Line with Color Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe add_shape method is used to add a reference line to the plot. In this example, a vertical reference line is added to the x-axis at the specified x-coordinate value.\nThe type=\"line\" parameter specifies that the added shape is a line. The x0 and x1 parameters are set to “Your_X_Value” to specify the x-coordinates where the line starts and ends. Replace “Your_X_Value” with the actual x-coordinate value where you want the reference line.\nThe y0 and y1 parameters set the starting and ending points on the y-axis. In this example, they are set to 0 and 1, respectively.\nThe line dictionary inside the shape specifies the attributes of the line, such as the color. In this case, the line color is set to red. Adjust the values as needed to customize the appearance of the reference line.\n\n\n\nReference marks - Verticle Reference Line with Text\n\n\nShow the code\nfig = px.bar(data, x='manufacturer', y=['cty', 'hwy'], barmode='group')\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title=\"Manufacturer\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Mileage\",\n    title_text=\"Average City and Highway Mileage by Manufacturer\"\n)\n\nfig.add_shape(\n    dict(\n        type=\"line\",\n        x0=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the line\n        x1=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the line\n        y0=0,\n        y1=1,\n        line=dict(color=\"red\"),  # Specify the color of the line\n    )\n)\n\nfig.add_annotation(\n    text=\"Your Text\",\n    x=\"Your_X_Value\",  # Specify the x-coordinate of the text\n    y=500,  # Adjust the y-coordinate of the text as needed\n    showarrow=False\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference marks - Verticle Reference Line with Text Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe add_shape method is used to add a reference line to the plot.

A relational database consists of tables/data sets that share columns. These shared columns then establish the relationship between the tables, thus the name relational database. The relations are sometimes not easily found and they require careful investigations.\nTo understand what is in a relational database, we can start with understanding the tables and the columns within.\nHere is a link to the readme file of the baseball database.\n\nWhat is the name of the table that records data about pitchers in the regular seasons?\n\n\nWhat do the HR and HBP columns mean in that table respectively?\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 2\n\nSELECT and FROM\nThe simplest SQL query is a query with SELECT and FROM. These are the keywords you will see again and again in SQL. Usually, when constructing a more complex query, it is easier to identify what goes into these two clauses first.\n\nCreate a query that shows all columns from the table you found in Exercise 1, save the dataframe in a variable “pitch”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nresult = pd.read_sql_query(\n    'SELECT _______ FROM _______',\n    con)\n\nresults\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 3\n\nWHERE\nThe WHERE keyword allows us to filter down the table horizontally (fewer rows).\nIt goes after SELECT and FROM.\n\nUsing a SQL query, select all rows in the same table where HR is lesser than 10 and gs is greater than 25.\n\n\nFind out what the columns mean and explain your query in words\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 4\n\nORDER BY\nORDER BY sort the table you select by one or more columns and goes after WHERE\n\nUsing the same query in exercise 2, edit it so that the table is ordered by the year of the season (nearest to furthermost) and the player ID (alphabetically).\n\n\n\n\n\nExcercise 5\n\nJoins\nJoins are used when you wish to create a new table through two different tables. Keep in mind that you have to identify the relationship between two tables before you can correctly join them.\nJOIN goes between FROM and WHERE.\n\nIdentify the shared columns (keys) and join the table in exercise 2 with the salaries table, then filter the data so that it shows only pitchers in the year 1986.\n\nYou should get a dataframe with 306 rows.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6\n\nGroup by\nGroup by is a keyword we use to lower the level of granularity of a table. Meaning we are combining rows into one by the given column(s).\nCreate a query that captures the number of pitchers the Washington Nationals used in each year, then sort the table by year\nYou should get a dataframe with 23 rows.",

You can read the documentation of the data on this page - https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/AER/Guns.html\n\n\nExercise 1\nOne of the first things we can do to a freshly imported data is to check its columns. This will help us understand the basic structure of the dataframe(table).\n\nUsing one line of code, select all the columns in dat, assign it to a variable called col_list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery dataframe has an attribute “columns”.\nAccessing this attribute will give you a list of all column names\n\n\n\nWe often want to know the dimension of a dataframe. How many columns are in the dataset? How many rows are in the dataset?\n\nUsing one line of code, show the number of columns and rows in df.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery dataframe has an attribute “shape”.\nAccessing this attribute will give you the dimension of a datafarme\n\n\n\nNow run df.head(). It will print out the first 5 rows of data in df.\n\nJust from looking at the output, what column(s) seems to be redundant with the row number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one column that serves as nothing but a row counter, that columns is redundant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nAfter a brief investigation of the data, we will clean up the data. By cleaning up, we are trying to filter down df so this only holds data we need. We will first get rid of the extra column we found in the previous excercise.\n\nUsing one line of code, drop the redundant column using the variable col_list (created in excercise 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse drop().\nUnderstand what “axis” is as a parameter of drop().\nYour function should looks like this:\ndf.drop([col_list[_]], axis = _)\nfill the “_“’s with the correct values and assign the output to df.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save the changes in df. Run df.head() to make sure the column is dropped in df.\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nWe have filtered df vertically by dropping a column. Now we will try to filter df horizontally, meaning we will get rid of some the rows.\nWe can do that by applying a condition to df. A condition is an expression that can be evaluated as True/False. For example, 8 &gt; 5 is an expression that evaluates to be True. This is trivial because 8 will always be greater than 5.\nRun the code below:\n\nwhat is the difference between exp1 and exp2?\n\nexp1 = 8 &gt; 5\nexp2 = df.violent &lt; 300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTry type() on else variable OR calling else variable.\n\n\n\nRun ths code below:\n\nBy putting df.violent &lt; 300, and the violent column from df into a dataframe, what is the relationship between the two columns?\n\nexp = pd.DataFrame({\"df.violent &lt; 300\" : exp2,\n                    \"violent value from dat\" : df.violent})\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTry computing df.violent[n] &lt; 300 and (df.violent &lt; 300)[n] where n is less than the number of row. The two expressions will always be the same as long as n is less than the number of rows.\n\n\n\n\nUsing query()to filter down the df so that it only contains the data for idaho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nquery() takes in expressions and filters down data.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save the changes in df. Run df.shape() to make sure the there are 23 rows and 13 columns.\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nBesides filtering, we can manipulate the data by adding new data to it. By adding a new column to the data, we assign a new value to each row.\n\nUsing assign(), create a new column that show the ratio between murder rate and violent rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse assign()\nYou see get the ratio by computing this code:\ndf.murder/df.violent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\nCreate a scatter plot that shows the relationship between murder rate and violent rate for the state of Idaho. Your chart should show murder rate as the x-axis, violent as the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you mimic this plot?\nhttps://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_tooltips.html"

    "text": "Intro to Titanic Machine Learning Skill Builder\nFor this skill builder, we’ll be putting our machine learning hats on. We’ll be creating a model that predicts whether a passenger survived. With machine learning, there is a lot of jargon! It can be quite overwhelming at times. This skill builder attempts to keep things basic and simple. With that being said, there are some terms that are important to understand. Let’s look at the first few rows of our dataset before proceeding with the definitions.\nThe titanic dataset will be used for examples of each definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsurvived\npclass\nsex\nage\nsiblings_spouses_aboard\nparents_children_aboard\nfare\n\n\n\n\n0\n3\n1\n22\n1\n0\n7.25\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n38\n1\n0\n71.2833\n\n\n1\n3\n0\n26\n0\n0\n7.925\n\n\n1\n1\n0\n35\n1\n0\n53.1\n\n\n0\n3\n1\n35\n0\n0\n8.05\n\n\n\n\nImportant Terms:\n\nfeatures: measurable property of the object you’re trying to predict. We use this information to predict our target of interest.\n\nExample: pclass, sex, age, siblings_spouses_aboard , parents_children_aboard, fare columns are all examples of different features.\nSynonyms: attributes, explanatory variables, independent variables, variables, X’s, covariates\n\ntarget: the feature that you are wanting to gain more insight into. The thing you are trying to predict.\n\nExample: in the titanic dataset our target is survived\nSynonyms: label, dependent variable, y\n\ntrain set: Usually 70% of the rows from the original dataset are randomly sampled to create this training data. It’s used by the algorithm, to determine, or learn, the optimal combinations of variables that will generate a good predictive model\n\nExample: Random sample of 70% of the original titanic dataset rows\nSynonyms: training data, train data, X_train, y_train\n\ntest set: Usually the remaining 30% of the rows in the original dataset are used to create this dataset. The testing data is a set of rows used only to assess the performance (i.e. generalization) of a model. To do this, the final model is used to predict classifications of examples in the test set. Those predictions are compared to the examples’ true classifications to assess the model’s accuracy.\n\nExample: Random sample of 30% of the original titanic dataset rows\nSynonyms: testing data, test data, X_test, y_test\n\nevaluation metrics: A statistic that tells you how well your predictions align with the actual values. Other words, tells you how good your model is.\n\nExample: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, MSE, MAE, Rsquared\nSynonyms: performance metric\n\n\nAgain, this is a very light and oversimplified treatment of machine learning. The purpose of this project is to help you understand the main concepts of ml and walk you through the process of building a machine learning model. A simplified work flow of a machine learning project is shown below. Spend some time getting familiar with this flow &mdash as you are about to code it… Exciting!\nNote in order to do this skill builder you will need to have scikit-learn installed on your machine. Run the following command in your terminal if you haven’t already.\npip install scikit-learn\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\nImports and Loading in Data\n# Loading in packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Loading in data\ndata = pd.read_csv(___)\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nCreate a chart exploring the relationship between age and survived in the titanic dataset. A strip plot, density plot, or boxplot might be useful here. Below is an example of a density plot. Feel free to replicate this chart or create your own.\nThe purpose of making this chart is to explore the relationships between a feature and the target. We want to see if the feature contains predictive information about the target. This is a large part of machine learning called Exploratory Data Analysis that should never be skipped! Spend time getting to know your features and how they interact with other features and the target.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nBuild a random forest model that is able to predict whether a passenger survived. This exercise is the bulk of the skill builder and contains several steps.\n\nStep 0: Split the data into X and y variables\nThe X variable will contain all your features\n# Removes the target and keeps all features\nX = data.drop(___, axis=1)  \nThe y variable will hold the target\n# Selects the target column\ny = data['___']  \n\n\nStep 1: Split data into train and test sets\nThe train_test_split function is useful for this task. Review the train_test_split function documentation\n# Splitting X and y variables into train and test sets using stratified sampling\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(___, ___, test_size=0.3,\n                                                    random_state=24, stratify=y)\n\n\nStep 2: Train the model\nExplore the RandomForestClassifier documentation for the RandomForestClassifier. It’s not necessary to understand the inner workings of the Random Forest algorithm for this class - just learn the syntax of fitting the model.\n# Creating random forest object\nrf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=24)  \n\n# Fit with the training data\nrf.fit(___, ___)  \n\n\nStep 3: Use test set to make predictions\n# Using the features in the test set to make predictions\ny_pred = rf.predict(___)  \n\n\nStep 4: Compare test set predictions to actual values. Calculate the accuracy.\n# Comparing predictions to actual values\naccuracy_score(___, ___)  \n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nWhat is the most important feature in making predictions? Why do you think this is?\nCreate a table that shows the feature importances in descending order. The random forest classifier has a feature importances attribute. It can be accessed by rf.feature_importances_. The table should look something like this.\n\n\n\nfeature names\nimportances\n\n\n\n\nfare\n0.288051\n\n\nsex\n0.281853\n\n\nage\n0.266491\n\n\npclass\n0.0814224\n\n\nsiblings_spouses_aboard\n0.0475633\n\n\nparents_children_aboard\n0.034619\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have completed this skill builder with your team (or on your own) then compare your work to our script\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the script.",

Programming will be extremely frustrating if we are not allowed to do web searches, so please get familiar with the tools you have and use them often.\n\n\n\nOffical Documentation\nThis should be your first resort for understanding any code/function.

This is another very useful resource since this is designed for this class. link to the textbook: https://byuidatascience.github.io/python4ds/\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nLocate the section where the textbook talks about query() and answer these questions.\n\nWhat function in R’s dplyr is equivalent or comparable to query() in pandas (You should include the section number in your answer)?\nWhat is the easiest mistake for python beginner to make that was shown in the text about query() (You should include the section number in your answer)?\n\n\nThe Internet\nGoogle is a programmer’s friend. Get used to googling thing, in fact, you want to be an expert in googling\n\nQuestion that cannot be answered by the textbook and documentation? Google it.\n\nA function you have never seen before? Google it.\nAn error in your code? Google it.\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nProvide at least 2 extra resources you could find about the pandas function drop() on the internet.\n\nTutor, TA (Through Slack, Zoom, or In-Person)\nWe want to help you with your work; we want to answer your questions; but most importantly, we want to help you succeed in this class. That will require you to put in the necessary time in understanding the readings, coding and debugging. When you ask us a question, we expect that you have read the documentation, searched the textbook, and done your own research. Then we can be most helpful and can provide insights on top of your understanding.\n\n\nExamples of Bad Questions\n\nHow does drop() work? We will ask you to read the documentation for drop().\nHow do you make a table in a markdown file? We will refer you to the textbook.\nI don’t want these columns in my data, how can I drop them? We will ask you if you have found any things on the internet.\n\n\n\nExamples of good questions\n\nI am still confused about the syntax of drop(). After reading the documentation, this is my understanding of the function… . What am I missing?\nI tried making a table in markdown (show code), it is still not giving me what I want, how can I fix this?\nI am trying to drop these columns in my dataframe, I think drop() is what I am looking for. Am I in the right direction? If not, what keywords should I be googling?\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nUsing the code and tools mentioned above, finish question 4 and 5 under 3.2.4 in the textbook.(use the data in mpg for your plot):\n# library import\nimport pandas as pd \nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# data import\nurl = \"https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/raw/master/data-raw/mpg/mpg.csv\"\n\nmpg = pd.read_csv(url)\n\nQuestion 4: Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.\nQuestion 5: What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you have completed this skill builder with your team (or on your own) then compare your work to our script\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the script.",

Saving altair plots programmatically\n\n\n\nabove plot to be saved\n\n\nLet’s say we want to save the above plot as a PNG file. Assuming we have already installed the altair library, we need to install the altair_saver.\n\n1.1 Installing the altair_saver\nWithin your interactive python window execute the following command.\nimport sys\n!{sys.executable} -m pip install altair_saver\n\n\n1.2 Additional tool for saving plots\nWe suggest NodeJS path. However, you are more than welcome to study Selenium for further understanding. The Github repository for altair_saver, the developers exclusively told us to install additional tools.\n\n\n1.3 Saving a plot using altair_saver\nIt might require you to restart VScode and import everything again for this to work. Please note that the plot will be saved in the same folder of the script.\nchart = alt.chart(&lt;data&gt;).&lt;chart_methods&gt;\nchart.save('name_of_chart.png')\n\n\n\n2. Save as PNG method\nThe method only requires us to have Altair library. Whenever we output a plot, we will see a button with three dots at the top right corner of the plot.\n\n\n\nClicking Save as PNG will bring us to a window to save our plot.\n\n\nClicking Save as PNG will bring us to a window to save our plot.\n\n\n3. Screenshot method\nIf all thing fails and we need to save a plot, the snip & sketch (Windows) or taking a screenshot (MacOS) will be our last resort.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

By 1976, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was given authority to restrict the use of asbestos in paint. Homes built during and before this period are known to have materials with asbestos YOu can read more about this ban.\nThe state of Colorado has a large portion of their residential dwelling data that is missing the year built and they would like you to build a predictive model that can classify if a house is built pre 1980.\nColorado gave you home sales data for the city of Denver from 2013 on which to train your model. They said all the column names should be descriptive enough for your modeling and that they would like you to use the latest machine learning methods.\n\n\nClient Request\nThe Client is a state agency in Colorado that is responsible for the health and safety of its residents. They have a large portion of their residential dwelling data that is missing the year built and they would like you to build a predictive model that can classify if a house is built pre 1980.\n\n\nData\nDownload: dwellings_ml.csv (ml ready)\nOptional Data: dwellings_neighborhoods_ml.csv (ml ready)\nInformational Data: dwellings_denver.csv (not cleansed)\nInformation: Data description\n\n\nReadings\n\nMachine Learning Introduction\nA visual introduction to machine learning\nHow to choose a good evaluation metric for your Machine learning model\n\n\nOptional References\n\nDecision Tree Classification in Python\n\nBoosted algorithms in scikit-learn\nscikit-plot package\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Tasks (Core)\n\nCreate 2-3 charts that evaluate potential relationships between the home variables and before1980. Explain what you learn from the charts that could help a machine learning algorithm.\nBuild a classification model labeling houses as being built “before 1980” or “during or after 1980”. Your goal is to reach or exceed 90% accuracy. Explain your final model choice (algorithm, tuning parameters, etc) and describe what other models you tried.\nJustify your classification model by discussing the most important features selected by your model. This discussion should include a feature importance chart and a description of the features.\nDescribe the quality of your classification model using 2-3 different evaluation metrics. You also need to explain how to interpret each of the evaluation metrics you use.\n\n\n\nQuestions and Tasks (Stretch)\nHere is an example Stretch question(s) for this project. Your instructor may assign different Stretch question(s). You must comment in Canvas when submitting your project if you completed any of the Stretch questions.\n\nRepeat the classification model using 3 different algorithms. Display their Feature Importance, and Decision Matrix.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Walkthrough\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will complete six projects during the semester that each take about two weeks (four days of class). On average, a student will spend 2 hours outside of class per hour in class to complete the assigned readings, submit any Canvas items, and complete the project (for a total of 8 hours per project). The instruction for each project will be structured into sections as written on this page.\nThis first Background section provides context for the project. Make sure you read the background carefully to see the big picture needs and purpose of the project.\n\n\n\nDelayed flights are not something most people look forward to. In the best case scenario you may only wait a few extra minutes for the plane to be cleaned. However, those few minutes can stretch into hours if a mechanical issue is discovered or a storm develops. Arriving hours late may result in you missing a connecting flight, job interview, or your best friend’s wedding.\nIn 2003 the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) began collecting data on the causes of delayed flights. The categories they use are Air Carrier, National Aviation System, Weather, Late-Arriving Aircraft, and Security. You can visit the BTS website to read definitions of these categories.\n\n\nClient Request\nThe JSON file for this project contains information on delays at 7 airports over 10 years. Your task is to clean the data, search for insights about flight delays, and communicate your results to the Client. The Client is a CEO of a flight booking app who is interested in the causes of flight delays and wants to know which airports have the worst delays. They also want to know the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length.\n\n\nData\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery data science project should start with data, and our class projects are no different. Each project will have ‘Download’ and ‘Information’ links like the ones below.\n\n\n\nDownload: JSON File\nInformation: Data Description\nSubject Matter: Types of Delay\n\n\nReadings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Readings section will contain links to reading assignments that are required for each project, as well as optional references. Remember that you are reading this material to build skills. Take the time to comprehend the readings and the skills contained within.\nWe recommend reading through the assigned material once for a general understanding before the first day of each project. You will reread and reference the material multiple times as you complete the project.\n\n\n\n\nP4DS: Section 12.1 & 12.2 Tidy data\nP4DS: Chapter 5 Data transformation\nP4DS: Section 7.4 Missing Values\nPython Data Science Handbook: Missing Data\nHandling Missing Data\nWikipedia Missing Data\n\n\nOptional References\n\nisin method\nwhere method\nnp.where method\nreplace method\nAn introduction to JSON (May need to open in ingognito to read.)\nThe key word in ‘Data Science’ is not Data…\nHow to Handle Missing Data (May need to open in ingognito to read.)\nLambda Function\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Tasks (Core)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section lists the questions and tasks that need to be completed for the project. Your work on the project must be compiled into a report, pushed to GitHub and a URL submitted in Canvas by the weekend following the last day of material for the project.\nThere are two types of questions: Core and Stretch. Core questions are required for each project. The course syllabus competencies requires specic a number of projects having all the Stretch questions achived based on your goals for the grade level you are seeking.\n\n\n\n\nFix all of the varied missing data types in the data to be consistent (all missing values should be displayed as “NaN”). In your report include one record example (one row) from your new data, in the raw JSON format. Your example should display the “NaN” for at least one missing value.__\nWhich airport has the worst delays? Describe the metric you chose, and why you chose it to determine the “worst” airport. Your answer should include a summary table that lists (for each airport) the total number of flights, total number of delayed flights, proportion of delayed flights, and average delay time in hours.\nWhat is the best month to fly if you want to avoid delays of any length? Describe the metric you chose and why you chose it to calculate your answer. Include one chart to help support your answer, with the x-axis ordered by month. (To answer this question, you will need to remove any rows that are missing the Month variable.)\nAccording to the BTS website, the “Weather” category only accounts for severe weather delays. Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:\n\n100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather\n\n30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather\n\nFrom April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%\n\nUsing the new weather variable calculated above, create a barplot showing the proportion of all flights that are delayed by weather at each airport. Describe what you learn from this graph.\n\n\n\nQuestions and Tasks (Stretch)\nHere is an example Stretch question(s) for this project. Your instructor may assign different Stretch question(s). You must comment in Canvas when submitting your project if you completed any of the Stretch questions.\n\nWhich delay is the worst delay? Create a similar analysis as above for Weahter Delay with: Carrier Delay and Security Delay. Compare the proportion of delay for each of the three categories in a Chart and a Table. Describe your results.\n\n\n\nDeliverables\nUse this template to submit your Client Report. The template has two sections:\n\nA short elevator pitch that highlights key values or metrics from the results. Describing these key insights to interest or hook the reader to want to read more about your work. The writing style should be more technical with some creative elements.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\n\n“The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device.” — John Tukey\n\nThis chapter introudces data visualization with the Plotly Express library. We briefly discus the grammar of graphics which is a useful paradigm for understanding the fundamentals of building graphs. Then we introudce the basics of Plotly Express and provide resources for further development.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nPlotly Express Install\nFor a slightly more interesting introduction, let’s look at the classic iris dataset built into the plotly.express data library. This dataset contains measurements on 3 species of irises.\nFirst, load the data by calling .data from the px library as follows:\n\nimport plotly.express as px\ndata = px.data.iris()\ndata.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal_length\nsepal_width\npetal_length\npetal_width\nspecies\nspecies_id\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n1\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo explore the relationship between sepal width and sepal length, we can start with a basic scatterplot.\n\npx.scatter(data,  x=\"sepal_width\", y=\"sepal_length\", title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\")\n\n                                                \n\n\nWhen all species are lumped together in this scatterplot it doesn’t look like there is much of a relationship between the sepal width and sepal length. We can improve our visualiztion by coloring the points based on species.\n\npx.scatter(data,  x=\"sepal_width\", y=\"sepal_length\", color = \"species\", title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\")\n\n                                                \n\n\nNotice that px has default hover labels related to x, y, and color. If we would like to modify what information is displayed when we hover over a point, we can add a “hover_data” option.\n\npx.scatter(data,  x=\"sepal_width\", y=\"sepal_length\", color = \"species\", hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\")\n\n                                                \n\n\nAs we increase the complexity of a visualization, our code starts to become less readable. Readable code is a magnificent skill to master. So a better way to express the same code as above is:\n\npx.scatter(data,\n    x=\"sepal_width\", \n    y=\"sepal_length\", \n    color = \"species\", \n    hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], \n    title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\"\n)\n\n                                                \n\n\nWe can also easily change the shape and size of the points in a scatterplot.\n\npx.scatter(data,\n    x=\"sepal_width\", \n    y=\"sepal_length\", \n    color = \"species\", \n    size = \"petal_length\",\n    symbol = \"species\",\n    hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], \n    title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\"\n)\n\n                                                \n\n\nNow that’s just silly! But hopefully the basic syntax for using px makes sense.\n\n\nMaking Plotly.Express More Presentable\nIn this section, we look at how to customize charts to be more informative and presentable. For example, column names in a dataset are rarely a good idea to present to someone not as intimately familiar with the data as you. We may also wish to highlight certain points, or draw attention to areas on a graph.\nTo begin, let’s return to a reasonable visualization of the iris data. We will start by naming our px chart object “fig” and changing the X and Y axis labels.\nThere are 2 ways to change labels. The more direct way is to include a “labels” dictionary in the figure inputs. The key-value pairs in this list are first, the variable name, and second, the desired label.\n\nfig = px.scatter(data,\n    x=\"sepal_width\", \n    y=\"sepal_length\", \n    color = \"species\", \n    symbol = \"species\",\n    labels={\"sepal_width\": \"Sepal Width\", \"sepal_length\": \"Sepal Length\", \"species\": \"Species\"},\n    hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], \n    title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\"\n)\n\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe next method makes the same adjustments but modifies the chart “post hoc”. Start with a very basic chart, “fig” and use the .update.layout() method to modify titles.\n\nfig = px.scatter(data,\n    x=\"sepal_width\", \n    y=\"sepal_length\", \n    color = \"species\", \n    symbol = \"species\",\n    hover_data=[\"species\", \"petal_width\"], \n    title = \"The relationship between sepal width and sepal length\"\n)\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    xaxis_title = \"Sepal Width\",\n    yaxis_title = \"Sepal Length\",\n    legend_title = \"Species\"\n)\n\n                                                \n\n\n The 2 approaches above have the same outcome, but the latter example introduces a flexible px paradigm that can be extended to other chart additions and modifications. For example, if we want to add a reference line to “fig”, we can use the .add_hline() method. \n\nfig.add_hline(\n    y = 7,\n    line_dash = \"dot\",\n    line_color = \"black\"\n)\n\n                                                \n\n\nWe can add several different shapes, including circles, lines or rectanges using the .add_shape() method. This method specifies what type of shape to add to the graph given a set of coordinates (x0, x1, y0, y1). “.add_shape()” can be used to draw reference lines as well, but still requires a all 4 coordinates.\n\n# Adds a horizontal line\nfig.add_shape(\n    type = \"circle\",\n    line_color = \"green\",\n    line_width = 3,\n    line_dash = \"dot\",\n    opacity = 1,\n    x0 = 3.7, x1=3.9,\n    y0=7.6,y1=8\n)\n\n                                                \n\n\nThe code above introduces many of the .add_shape() features all at once, not all of which are necessary for every situation. But hopefully this gives a flavor of what can be done.\nNotice also, that the .add_ methods actually update fig. No need to overwrite the original object or create a new chart object for each modification.\n\nfig.show()\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nOther .add_itions\nThere are several other useful “post hoc” graph modifications that we only mention in this chapter. For further exploration, see Plotly Express Styling.\nUse fig.add_annotation() to add text with or without arrows pointing to specific locations. Update axes by using fig.update_yaxes() or fig.update_xaxes which allows you to modify gridlines and add units of measure like “%” or “$”. .add_vrect() and add_hrect() allow you to highlight regions vertically or horizontally. The possibilities are almost endless!\n\n\nResources\nThis chapter has introudced the basics of plotly.express, but we have only looked at a scatterplot. For links to further documentation and a whole gallery of px possibilities, see Plotly Express in Python.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

We are keeping Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham’s writing and examples as much as possible while demonstrating Python instead of R. We have focused on pandas and Altair in our Python code snippets.\nThis book will teach you how to do data science with Python: You’ll learn how to get your data into Python, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with Python. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.\n\nLearn How to Setup Python\nPython\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",

On average, a student will spend 2 hours outside of class per hour in class to complete the assigned readings, submit any Canvas items, and complete the project (for a total of 8 hours per project). The instruction for each project will be structured into sections as written on this page.\nThis first Background section provides context for the project. Make sure you read the background carefully to see the big picture needs and purpose of the project.\n\n\n\nEarly in prehistory, some descriptive names began to be used again and again until they formed a name pool for a particular culture. Parents would choose names from the pool of existing names rather than invent new ones for their children.\nWith the rise of Christianity, certain trends in naming practices manifested. Christians were encouraged to name their children after saints and martyrs of the church. These early Christian names can be found in many cultures today, in various forms. These were spread by early missionaries throughout the Mediterranean basin and Europe.\nBy the Middle Ages, the Christian influence on naming practices was pervasive. Each culture had its pool of names, which were a combination of native names and early Christian names that had been in the language long enough to be considered native. [ref]\n\n\nClient Request\nThis csv file contains the number of times a name was given to a child in a specific year. The Client has a passion for names throughout history. They would like to know how the usage of names has changed over time. They are particularly interested in the names Mary, Martha, Peter, and Paul.

But a relationship is simply a way to describe how two or more objects are connected. There are many relationships in baseball such as those between teams and managers, players and salaries, even stadiums and concession prices.\nThe graphs on Data Visualizations from Best Tickets show many other relationships that exist in baseball.\n\n\nClient Request\nFor this project, the Client wants SQL queries that they can use to retrieve data for use on their website without needing Python.

The new table should contain five columns: playerID, schoolID, salary, and the yearID/teamID associated with each salary. Order the table by salary (highest to lowest) and print out the table in your report.\nThis three-part question requires you to calculate batting average (number of hits divided by the number of at-bats)\n\nWrite an SQL query that provides playerID, yearID, and batting average for players with at least 1 at bat that year. Sort the table from highest batting average to lowest, and then by playerid alphabetically. Show the top 5 results in your report.\n\nUse the same query as above, but only include players with at least 10 at bats that year. Print the top 5 results.\n\nNow calculate the batting average for players over their entire careers (all years combined). Only include players with at least 100 at bats, and print the top 5 results.\n\nPick any two baseball teams and compare them using a metric of your choice (average salary, home runs, number of wins, etc). Write an SQL query to get the data you need, then make a graph using Plotly Express to visualize the comparison. What do you learn?\n\n\n\nQuestions and Tasks (Stretch)\nHere is an example Stretch question(s) for this project. Your instructor may assign different Stretch question(s). You must comment in Canvas when submitting your project if you completed any of the Stretch questions.\n\nAdvanced Salary Distribution by Position (with Case Statement):\n\nWrite an SQL query that provides a summary table showing the average salary for players in each position (e.g., pitcher, catcher, outfielder) across all years. Include the following columns:\n\nposition\naverage_salary\ntotal_players\nhighest_salary\n\nThe highest_salary column should display the highest salary ever earned by a player in that position. If no player in that position has a recorded salary, display “N/A” for the highest salary.\nAdditionally, create a new column called salary_category using a case statement:\n\nIf the average salary is above $1 million, categorize it as “High Salary.”\n\nIf the average salary is between $500,000 and $1 million, categorize it as “Medium Salary.”\n\nOtherwise, categorize it as “Low Salary.”\n\nOrder the table by average salary in descending order.\nPrint the top 10 rows of this summary table.\n\nAdvanced Career Longevity and Performance (with Subqueries):\n\nCalculate the average career length (in years) for players who have played at least one game. Then, identify the top 10 players with the longest careers (based on the number of years they played). Include their:\n\nplayerID\nfirst_name\nlast_name\ncareer_length\n\nThe career_length should be calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum yearID for each player.\n\n\n\n\nDeliverables\nUse this template to submit your Client Report.

    "text": "First steps\nLet’s use our first graph to answer a question: Do cars with big engines use more fuel than cars with small engines? You probably already have an answer, but try to make your answer precise. What does the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear?\n\nThe mpg data frame\nYou can test your answer with the mpg data frame found in ggplot2 (aka ggplot2::mpg). A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). The ‘mpg’ data contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car. We will identify the ‘mpg’ data using mpg for the remainder of this introduction.\n\nurl = \"https://github.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/raw/master/data-raw/mpg/mpg.csv\"\nmpg = pd.read_csv(url)\n\nAmong the variables in mpg are:\n\ndispl, a car’s engine size, in litres.\nhwy, a car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.\n\nTo learn more about mpg, read its format at data4python4ds.\n\n\nCreating an Altair plot\nTo plot mpg, run this code to put displ on the x-axis and hwy on the y-axis:\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x='displ', \n    y='hwy')\n  .mark_circle()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart = px.scatter(mpg,\n    x='displ', \n\n    y='hwy'\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (displ) and fuel efficiency (hwy). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel. Does this confirm or refute your hypothesis about fuel efficiency and engine size?\nWith Altair, you begin a plot with the function Chart(). Chart() creates a Chart object that you can add layers to. The only argument of Chart() is the dataset to use in the graph. So Chart(mpg) creates an Chart object upon which we can marks.\nYou complete your graph by adding one or more marks to Chart(). The attribute .mark_point() adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot. Altair comes with many mark methods that each add a different type of layer to a plot. You’ll learn a whole bunch of them throughout this chapter.\nEach mark method in Altair has an .encode() attribute. This defines how variables in your dataset are encoded to visual properties. The .encode() method is always paired with x and y arguments to specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. Altair looks for the encoded variables in the data argument, in this case, mpg. For pandas dataframes, Altair automatically determines the appropriate data type for the mapped column.\n\n\nA graphing template\nLet’s turn this code into a reusable template for making graphs with ggplot2. To make a graph, replace the bracketed sections in the code below with a dataset, a geom function, or a collection of mappings.\n(alt.Chart(&lt;DATA&gt;)  \n   .encode(&lt;ENCODINGS&gt;)\n    &lt;.mark_*()&gt;)\nThe rest of this chapter will show you how to complete and extend this template to make different types of graphs. We will begin with the &lt;ENCODINGS&gt; component.\n\n\nExercises\n\nRun Chart(mpg).mark_point(). What do you see?\nHow many rows are in mpg? How many columns?\nWhat does the drv variable describe?\nMake a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.\nWhat happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?"

One way to test this hypothesis is to look at the class value for each car. The class variable of the mpg dataset classifies cars into groups such as compact, midsize, and SUV. If the outlying points are hybrids, they should be classified as compact cars or, perhaps, subcompact cars (keep in mind that this data was collected before hybrid trucks and SUVs became popular).\nYou can add a third variable, like class, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to an encoding. An encoding is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Encodings include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. You can display a point (like the one below) in different ways by changing the values of its encoded properties. Since we already use the word “value” to describe data, let’s use the word “level” to describe encoded properties. Here we change the levels of a point’s size, shape, and color to make the point small, triangular, or blue:\nYou can convey information about your data by mapping the encodings in your plot to the variables in your dataset. For example, you can map the colors of your points to the class variable to reveal the class of each car.\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    color = \"class\"\n    )\n  .mark_circle())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart = (px.scatter(mpg,\n  x = \"displ\",\n  y = \"hwy\",\n  color = \"class\"\n  )\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n(We don’t prefer British English, like Hadley, so don’t use colour instead of color.)\nTo map an encoding to a variable, associate the name of the encoding to the name of the variable inside .encode(). Altair will automatically assign a unique level of the encoding (here a unique color) to each unique value of the variable, a process known as scaling. Altair will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values.\nThe colors reveal that many of the unusual points are two-seater cars. These cars don’t seem like hybrids, and are, in fact, sports cars! Sports cars have large engines like SUVs and pickup trucks, but small bodies like midsize and compact cars, which improves their gas mileage. In hindsight, these cars were unlikely to be hybrids since they have large engines.\nIn the above example, we mapped class to the color encoding, but we could have mapped class to the size encoding in the same way. In this case, the exact size of each point would reveal its class affiliation. Mapping an unordered variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size) is not a good idea.\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    size = \"class\"\n    )\n  .mark_circle())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart = (px.scatter(mpg,\n  x = \"displ\",\n  y = \"hwy\",\n  size = \"size\",\n  size_max = 5,\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we could have mapped class to the opacity encoding, which controls the transparency of the points, or to the shape encoding, which controls the shape of the points.\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart1 = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    opacity = \"class\"\n    )\n  .mark_circle())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchart2 = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    shape = \"class\"\n    )\n  .mark_point())\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart1 = (px.scatter(mpg,\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    opacity=0.5\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchart2 = (px.scatter(mpg,\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    symbol = \"class\"\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\nAltair will only use 8 shapes for one chart. Charting more than 8 shapes is not recommended as the shapes simply recycle.\nFor each encoding, you use .encode() to associate the name of the encoding with a variable to display. The .encode() function gathers together each of the encoded mappings used by a layer and passes them to the layer’s mapping argument. The syntax highlights a useful insight about x and y: the x and y locations of a point are themselves encodings, visual properties that you can map to variables to display information about the data.\nOnce you map an encoding, Altair takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable scale to use with the encoding, and it constructs a legend that explains the mapping between levels and values. For x and y aesthetics, Altair does not create a legend, but it creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line acts as a legend; it explains the mapping between locations and values.\nYou can also configure the encoding properties of your mark manually. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue:\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x='displ',\n    y='hwy',\n    color=alt.value('blue')\n  )\n  .mark_circle())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart = px.scatter(mpg,\n  x='displ',\n  y='hwy'\n).update_traces(marker=dict(color='blue'))\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the color doesn’t convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot. To set an encoding manually, use alt.value() by name as an argument of your .encode() function; i.e. the value goes inside of alt.value(). You’ll need to pick a level that makes sense for that encoding:\n\nThe name of a color as a character string.\nThe size of a point in pixels.\nThe shape of a point as a character string.\n\nNote that only a limited set of mark properties can be bound to encodings, so for some (e.g. fillOpacity, strokeOpacity, etc.) the encoding approach using alt.value() is not available. Encoding settings will always override local or global configuration settings. There are other methods for manually encoding properties as explained in the Altair documentation\n\nExercises\n\nWhich variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are continuous? How can you see this information when you run mpg? (Hint mpg.dtypes)\nMap a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?\nWhat happens if you map the same variable to multiple encodings?\nWhat does the stroke encoding do?

Python is extremely picky, and a misplaced character can make all the difference. Make sure that every ( is matched with a ) and every \" is paired with another \".\nOne common problem when creating Altair graphics as shown in this book, is to put the () in the wrong place: the ( comes before the alt.chart() command and the ) has to come at the end of the command.\nFor example the code below works in Python.\nalt.Chart(mpg).encode(x = \"displ\", y = \"hwy\").mark_circle()\nHowever, the complexity of the more details graphics necessitates placing the code on multiple lines. When using multiple lines we need the enclosing ().

But the plots are not identical. Each plot uses a different visual object to represent the data. In Altair syntax, we say that they use different marks.\nA mark is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. People often describe plots by the type of mark that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar marks, line charts use line marks, boxplots use boxplot marks, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point mark. As we see above, you can use different marks to plot the same data. The first plot uses the point mark, and the second plot uses the line mark, a smooth line fitted to the data is calculated using a transformation. To change the mark in your plot, change the mark function that you add to Chart().\nEvery mark function in Altair has encode arguments. However, not every encoding works with every mark. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn’t set the “shape” of a line. On the other hand, you could set the type of line. .mark_line() will draw a different line, with a different strokeDash, for each unique value of the variable that you map to strokeDash.\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .transform_loess(\"displ\", \"hwy\", groupby = [\"drv\"])\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    strokeDash = \"drv\"\n    )\n    .mark_line())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart = px.scatter(mpg, \n\n                  x='displ',\n\n                  y='hwy', \n\n                  color='drv'\n                  )\n\n\n\n\n\nHere .mark_line() separates the cars into three lines based on their drv value, which describes a car’s drivetrain. One line describes all of the points with a 4 value, one line describes all of the points with an f value, and one line describes all of the points with an r value. Here, 4 stands for four-wheel drive, f for front-wheel drive, and r for rear-wheel drive.\nIf this sounds strange, we can make it more clear by overlaying the lines on top of the raw data and then coloring everything according to drv.\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nchartp = (alt.Chart(mpg).\n  mark_circle().\n  encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    strokeDash = \"drv\",\n    color = \"drv\"\n  ))\nchart = chartp + chartp.transform_loess(\"displ\", \"hwy\", groupby = [\"drv\"]).mark_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nfig = px.scatter(mpg, \n  x='displ',\n\n  y='hwy', \n\n  color='drv', \n\n  symbol='drv', \n  trendline='lowess')\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that this plot contains two marks in the same graph! If this makes you excited, buckle up. We will learn how to place multiple marks on the same chart very soon.\nAltair provides about 15 marks. The best way to get a comprehensive overview is the Altair marks page, which you can find at https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/marks.html.\nMany marks, like .mark_line(), use a single mark object to display multiple rows of data. For these marks, you can set the detail encoding to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects. Altair will draw a separate object for each unique value of the detail variable. In practice, Altair will automatically group the data for these marks whenever you map an encoding to a discrete variable (as in the strokeDash example). It is convenient to rely on this feature because the detail encoding by itself does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the marks.\n\n\nAltair\n\nchartleft = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    )\n\n  .transform_loess(\"displ\", \"hwy\")\n  .mark_line())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchartmiddle = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    detail = \"drv\"\n    )\n  .transform_loess(\"displ\", \"hwy\", groupby = [\"drv\"])\n  .mark_line())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchartright = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    color=alt.Color(\"drv\", legend=None)\n    )\n  .transform_loess(\"displ\", \"hwy\", groupby = [\"drv\"])\n  .mark_line())\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchartleftpx = px.scatter(mpg, \n\n  x='displ', \n\n  y='hwy', \n\n  trendline='lowess')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchartmiddlepx = px.scatter(mpg, \n\n  x='displ',\n\n  y='hwy',\n\n\n  trendline='lowess')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchartrightpx = px.scatter(mpg, \n  x='displ',\n\n  y='hwy', \n\n  color='drv', \n  trendline='lowess', \n  color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Plotly)\n\n\n\n::::\nTo display multiple marks in the same plot, you can used layered charts as shown in the example below that uses the chartleft object from the above code chunk:\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nchartp = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\"\n  )\n  .mark_circle()\n)\nchart = chartp + chartleft \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nfig = px.scatter(\n  mpg, \n\n  x='displ', \n\n  y='hwy',  \n\n  trendline='lowess')\n\n\n\n\n\nThis, however, introduces some duplication in our code. Imagine if you wanted to change the y-axis to display cty instead of hwy. You’d need to change the variable in two places, and you might forget to update one. You can avoid this type of repetition by passing a set of encodings to a base alt.Chart(). Altair will treat these encodings as global encodings that apply to each mark layer in the layered chart. In other words, this code will produce the same plot as the previous code:\n\n\nAltair\n\nbase = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\"\n    ))\nchart = base.mark_circle() + base.transform_loess(\"displ\", \"hwy\").mark_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart = px.scatter(\n  mpg, \n  x='displ',\n  y='hwy',\n\n  trendline='lowess')\n\n\n\n\nIf you place encodings in an encode function, Altair will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the base encodings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers. Alatair automatically chooses useful plot settings and chart configurations to allow you to think about data instead of the programming mechanics of the chart. You can review their guidance on customizing visualizations to see the varied ways to change the look of your graphic.\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nbase =(alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\"\n  ))\n\nchart = base.encode(color = \"drv\").mark_circle() + base.transform_loess(\"displ\", \"hwy\").mark_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart = px.scatter(\n  mpg, \n  x='displ',\n  y='hwy',\n\n  trendline='lowess',\n\n  color = \"drv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the same idea to specify different data for each layer. Here, our smooth line displays just a subset of the mpg dataset, the subcompact cars. The .transform_filter method overrides the global data from the base chart for that layer only.\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nbase = (alt.Chart(mpg.rename(columns = {\"class\": \"class1\"}))\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\"\n    ))\n\nchart_smooth_sub = (base\n  .transform_filter(alt.datum.class1 == \"subcompact\")\n  .transform_loess(\"displ\", \"hwy\")\n  .mark_line()\n)  \n\nchart = base.encode(color = \"class1\").mark_circle() + chart_smooth_sub\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nmpg.rename(columns={\"class\": \"class1\"}, inplace=True)\n\nbase = px.scatter(mpg, x='displ', y='hwy', color='class1').data[0]\n\nsubcompact_mpg = mpg[mpg['class1'] == 'subcompact']\n\nsmoothed_subcompact = lowess(subcompact_mpg['hwy'], subcompact_mpg['displ'], return_sorted=False)\nsmoothed_subcompact_df = pd.DataFrame({'displ': subcompact_mpg['displ'], 'smoothed_hwy': smoothed_subcompact})\n\nline = px.line(smoothed_subcompact_df, x='displ', y='smoothed_hwy').data[0]\n\nfig = px.scatter(mpg, x='displ', y='hwy', color='class1')\n\n\n\n\n\n(You’ll learn how pandas filter works in the chapter on data transformations.

The chart shows that more diamonds are available with high quality cuts than with low quality cuts.\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart = (alt.Chart(diamonds)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"cut\",\n    y = alt.Y(\"count():Q\")\n    )\n  .mark_bar()\n  .properties(width = 400))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart = px.bar(diamonds, \n  x='cut', \n  y='cut', \n  title='Number of Diamonds by Cut', \n  labels={'cut': 'Count'})\n\nchart.update_layout(width=400)\n\nchart.write_image(\"PlotlyCharts/chart25.png\")\n\n\n\n\nOn the x-axis, the chart displays cut, a variable from diamonds. On the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in diamonds! Many graphs, like scatterplots, plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:\n\nbar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.\nsmoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.\nboxplots compute a robust summary of the distribution and then display a specially formatted box.\n\nThe algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a transform, short for transformation. The figure below describes how this process works with .mark_bar().\nYou must explicitely define the transformation a mark uses through transformations using alt.Y() or alt.X() function. For example, mark_bar() requires the y encoding alt.Y(\"count():Q\"). A histogram is created using .mark_bar() with transformations on both the x and y axes. The bin argument accepts a boolean or an alt.Bin() function where the argument maxbins can be used - bin=alt.Bin(maxbins=100).\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart = (alt.Chart(diamonds)\n  .encode(\n    x =alt.X(\"price\", bin=True),\n    y =alt.Y(\"count()\")\n    )\n  .mark_bar())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart = px.histogram(diamonds, \n  x='price', \n  nbins=10, \n  title='Distribution of Diamond Prices')\n\n\n\n\nFor more complicated transformations Altair provides transform functions. We saw one of these transforms previously when we used .mark_line() to describe each drive type. If you are working with pandas DataFrames then you may want to do these transformations using pandas. Altair’s transformations can be used with DataFrames as well as JSON files or URL pointers to CSV files.\n\n\nAltair\n\nchartright = (alt.Chart(mpg)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"displ\",\n    y = \"hwy\",\n    color=alt.Color(\"drv\", legend=None)\n    )\n  .transform_loess(\"displ\", \"hwy\", groupby = [\"drv\"])\n  .mark_line())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nsmoothed = lowess(mpg['hwy'], mpg['displ'], return_sorted=False)\nmpg['smoothed_hwy'] = smoothed\n\nfig = px.line(mpg, \n  x='displ',\n  y='smoothed_hwy', \n  color='drv')\n\n\n\n\nFinally, .mark_boxplot() is available which does the statistical transformations for you after you specify the encodings for the x and y axes.\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart = (alt.Chart(diamonds)\n  .encode(\n    y =\"price\",\n    x =\"cut\"\n    )\n  .mark_boxplot(size = 25)\n  .properties(width = 300))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nfig = px.box(diamonds, y='price', x='cut', title='Price Distribution by Cut',\n             labels={'price': 'Price', 'cut': 'Cut'})"

You can colour a bar chart using either the stroke aesthetic, or, more usefully, color:\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart_left = (alt.Chart(diamonds)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"cut\",\n    y = alt.Y(\"count()\"),\n    stroke = \"cut\"\n    )\n  .mark_bar()\n  .properties(width = 200))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchart_right = (alt.Chart(diamonds)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"cut\",\n    y = alt.Y(\"count()\"),\n    color = \"cut\"\n    )\n  .mark_bar()\n  .properties(width = 200))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nchart_left_px = px.bar(diamonds, \n  x='cut', \n  y='cut',\n  labels={'cut': 'Count'}, color='cut')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchart_right_px = px.bar(diamonds, x='cut', y='cut', title='Number of Diamonds by Cut',\n             labels={'cut': 'Count'}, color='cut')\n\n\n\nNote what happens if you map the color encoding to another variable, like clarity: the bars are automatically stacked. Each colored rectangle represents a combination of cut and clarity.\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart = (alt.Chart(diamonds)\n  .encode(\n    x = \"cut\",\n    y = alt.Y(\"count()\"),\n    color = \"clarity\"\n    )\n  .mark_bar()\n  .properties(width = 200))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nfig = px.bar(diamonds, \n  x='cut', \n  y='cut',\n  labels={'cut': 'Cut', 'clarity': 'Clarity', 'count': 'Count'}, color='clarity')\n\n\n\n\nThe stacking is performed automatically by .mark_bar(). If you don’t want a stacked bar chart, you can use use the stack argument in alt.Y() one of three other options: \"identity\", \"dodge\" or \"fill\".\n\nposition = \"identity\" will place each object exactly where it falls in the context of the graph. This is not very useful for bars, because it overlaps them. To see that overlapping we either need to make the bars slightly transparent by setting alpha to a small value, or completely transparent by setting fill = NA.\n\n\n\nAltair\n\nchart_left = (alt.Chart(diamonds)\n        .encode(\n          x = \"cut\",\n          y = alt.Y(\"count()\", stack=None),\n          color = \"clarity\",\n          opacity = alt.value(1/5)\n          )\n        .mark_bar()\n        .properties(width = 200))      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchart_right = (alt.Chart(diamonds)\n        .encode(\n          x = \"cut\",\n          y = alt.Y(\"count()\", stack=None),\n          stroke = \"clarity\",\n          color = alt.value(\"none\")\n          )\n        .mark_bar()\n        .properties(width = 200))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly Express\n\nfig = px.bar(diamonds, \n  x='cut', \n  y='cut',\n  labels={'cut': 'Cut', 'clarity': 'Clarity', 'count': 'Count'}, color='clarity',\n  opacity=1/5, barmode='group')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfig = px.bar(diamonds, \n  x='cut',\n  y='cut', \n  labels={'cut': 'Cut', 'clarity': 'Clarity', 'count': 'Count'}, \n  color_discrete_sequence=['rgba(0,0,0,0)'],\n  color='clarity', barmode='group')\n\n\n\n\nposition = \"fill\" works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height.

Altair can create a jittered point plot, also called a stripplot. However, it is not as straight forward.\nWe should note that Altair also does not provide piechart or donut chart marks as well."

This coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system, where the x and y positions act independently to determine the location of each point. Maps are on a Cartesian coordinate system, but their behavior is different as they require a transformation or projection of the globe to an x and y Cartesian plane.\nVisualizing data on maps can get complicated quickly. Altair has a some mapping marks available for charts. The data formats for plotting with maps also get more involved. You can use the gpdvega package to help with spatial data in Altair. Many Python users us geopandas or Shapely to handle spatial data in Python. PennState has a nice list of spatial tools for Python."

    "text": "The layered grammar of graphics\nIn the previous sections, you learned much more than how to make scatterplots, bar charts, and boxplots. You learned a foundation that you can use to make any type of plot with Altair. To see this, let’s add position adjustments, stats, coordinate systems, and faceting to our code template:\n(alt.Chart(&lt;DATA&gt;)\n  .encoding(\n    \n    )\n  .facet(\n    column = &lt;FACET VARIABLE&gt;\n    )\n  .&lt;TRANFORM_FUNCTION&gt;()\n  .&lt;MARK_FUNCTION&gt;()\n  .properties(\n    width = ,\n    height = \n  ))\nAltair’s general template takes four main parameters - alt.Chart(), .mark_*(), .encode(), and .facet(). In practice, only need to supply the first three parameters to make a chart because Altair will provide useful defaults for everything except the data, the encodings, and the mark function.\nThe parameters in the template compose the grammar of graphics, a formal system for building plots. The grammar of graphics is based on the insight that you can uniquely describe any plot as a combination of a dataset, a mark, a set of encodings, a transformation, a position adjustment, and a faceting scheme.\nTo see how this works, consider how you could build a basic plot from scratch: you could start with a dataset and then transform it into the information that you want to display (with a stat).\nNext, you could choose a geometric object to represent each observation in the transformed data. You could then use the aesthetic properties of the geoms to represent variables in the data. You would map the values of each variable to the levels of an aesthetic.\nYou’d then select a coordinate system to place the geoms into. You’d use the location of the objects (which is itself an aesthetic property) to display the values of the x and y variables. At that point, you would have a complete graph, but you could further adjust the positions of the geoms within the coordinate system (a position adjustment) or split the graph into subplots (faceting). You could also extend the plot by adding one or more additional layers, where each additional layer uses a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, and a position adjustment.\nYou could use this method to build any plot that you imagine. In other words, you can use the code template that you’ve learned in this chapter to build hundreds of thousands of unique plots."

It contains columns that are categorical. Sklearn cannot handle columns that are strings, so we need to convert these into a numerical representation. We accomplish this by either one hot encoding, label encoding, or taking just one value of the range provided. There are many other ways to represent these columns as numbers, but they are beyond the scope of this course.\nOnce you’ve converted all columns to numeric, in an intelligent way, you will be asked to recreate a graph using plotly express.

It will print out the first 5 rows of data in df.\n\nJust from looking at the output, what column(s) seems to be redundant with the row number?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one column that serves as nothing but a row counter, that columns is redundant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nAfter a brief investigation of the data, we will clean up the data. By cleaning up, we are trying to filter down df so this only holds data we need. We will first get rid of the extra column we found in the previous excercise.\n\nUsing one line of code, drop the redundant column using the variable col_list (created in excercise 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse drop().\nUnderstand what “axis” is as a parameter of drop().\nYour function should looks like this:\ndf.drop([col_list[_]], axis = _)\nfill the “_“’s with the correct values and assign the output to df.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save the changes in df. Run df.head() to make sure the column is dropped in df.\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nWe have filtered df vertically by dropping a column. Now we will try to filter df horizontally, meaning we will get rid of some the rows.\nWe can do that by applying a condition to df. A condition is an expression that can be evaluated as True/False. For example, 8 &gt; 5 is an expression that evaluates to be True. This is trivial because 8 will always be greater than 5.\nRun the code below:\n\nwhat is the difference between exp1 and exp2?\n\nexp1 = 8 &gt; 5\nexp2 = df.violent &lt; 300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTry type() on else variable OR calling else variable.\n\n\n\nRun ths code below:\n\nBy putting df.violent &lt; 300, and the violent column from df into a dataframe, what is the relationship between the two columns?\n\nexp = pd.DataFrame({\"df.violent &lt; 300\" : exp2,\n                    \"violent value from dat\" : df.violent})\n\nexp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTry computing df.violent[n] &lt; 300 and (df.violent &lt; 300)[n] where n is less than the number of row. The two expressions will always be the same as long as n is less than the number of rows.\n\n\n\n\nUsing query()to filter down the df so that it only contains the data for idaho\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nquery() takes in expressions and filters down data.\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save the changes in df. Run df.shape() to make sure the there are 23 rows and 13 columns.\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nBesides filtering, we can manipulate the data by adding new data to it. By adding a new column to the data, we assign a new value to each row.\n\nUsing assign(), create a new column that show the ratio between murder rate and violent rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nUse assign()\nYou see get the ratio by computing this code:\ndf.murder/df.violent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\nCreate a scatter plot that shows the relationship between murder rate and violent rate for the state of Idaho. Your chart should show murder rate as the x-axis, violent as the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you mimic this plot while using Plotly-Express?\nhttps://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/scatter_tooltips.html https://plotly.com/python/line-and-scatter/",

There is a draft submission due Wednesday (W) of the 2nd week of the project and the final draft due the following Saturday (S). This gives you 2 attempts to get full points on the project. There are 6 two-week projects (P0-P5) and 1 one-week project (P6). Typically no resubmissions are allowed once the project closes in Canvas. Make the changes and take advantage of the resubmit within this window.\nProjects 1-5 will have stretch questions. You must complete all the core qeustions first before attempting the stretch questions. You must complete all the stretch questions accurately for the project to count toward the competencies. The number in the competencies relating to Project Stretches is the number of projects with all the stretch questions completed.\n\nGrading Details\n\n1 point: Submission\n3 points: Submission of a good faith attempt with a statement of work quality.\n4 points: High-quality work that addresses each of the Questions and Tasks and a comment in Canvas of your statement of work quality.\n5 points: Addressed issues and completion of resubmission (if needed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoints (methods and calculations)\nThese Methods and Calculation Quizzes are in Canvas and they open when the project starts. They have unlimited attempts and remain open until the end of the semester. You must get a 100% on these quizzes for them to count toward the competencies.\n\nExamples\n\nFact-Finding Questions (Calculate descriptive summaries): Fact-finding questions help you with calculations that build into the Questions and Tasks of the project. These questions have clearly defined answers using Python calculations. You should expect 2-3 problems.\n\n\nExample: Using the top 10 airports in size, what is the average size?\nExample: What proportion of flights are delayed at the largest airport?\n\n\nHow the code works questions (Explaining the tools): This part could have direct answer questions or open-ended questions.\n\n\nExample (direct): What is the recommended function for arranging your data by a variable? What are the outputs after using &lt;FUNCTION&gt;?\nExample (open): Your client has shown some confusion about NumPy’s ‘nan’ handling in Python. Help them understand by answering the question, ‘How is missing data handled in Pandas?’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheckpoints (Mid-project status)\nThe mid-project checkpoint has a few questions. It opens the first day of the project and closes on the first Saturday of a 2 week project. It has the following questions.\n\nExamples\n\nThroughout this project, you have worked on a code. Record a video showing your code that is no more than 1 minute. This video must include: &gt; How long have you worked on this code? &gt; What is your code designed to do? &gt; What are, if any, the issues you’re facing? &gt; What questions or tasks have you checked off?\nSubmit your 1 minute video. &gt; You may share any additional notes with your teacher using the Canvas comment feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Science Community\nTo earn credit for the DS Community element you must complete tasks from the list below. At the end of the semester, you will be asked to report on how many tasks you completed and what you learned from them. See the Competency Scale above to determine how many you need to complete based on the grade you want.\n\nAttend Data Science Society at least once.\nSign up for an email newsletter that will teach you more about data science. Data Science Weekly or Data Elixir are good options.\nListen to a podcast episode about data science. Build a Career in Data Science has some excellent episodes.\nWatch a professional presentation on YouTube about data science. Be prepared to share the link and a summary of the video.\nReach out to someone who works in a data-related field and ask them for 15 minutes of their time. Use this time to conduct an “informational interview” and learn more about their responsibilities and career path.\nResearch and apply to at least 5 data-related jobs or internships.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinishing the semester\nSubmit a Course Goals Letter (End) that includes what you have learned from this class, the next data science course you plan on taking, and the final grade that you are requesting based on the work you have submitted compared to the competencies above.\n\n\n\n\nCoding challenge\nWe will have a timed (60 min) coding challenge on the ultimate or penultimate day of class. This is not a traditional exam and is similar to the projects all semester in size and scope but is accumulative. It will cover the general techniques that we have been practicing throughout the course. You will rely on your code from the projects and the methods and calculations checkpoints to complete the challenge.\nWe expect to have a few practice challenges throughout the semester. We will score the coding challenge on a four-point scale.\n\n1 point: At least you tried.\n2 points: You have learned some items from the course, but your work in the coding challenge is deficient.\n3 points: Your submission uses proper coding techniques and addresses the objective.\n4 points: Exceptional work. Your code can be used as a solution to share with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
