### Setup Git and GitHub 
#### GitHub will be used for publishing all projects

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer   
    * [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) Installation
        Note: Keep all settings as default during installation
    * [Mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) Installation  
        Note: Mac users can install git using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running `brew install git` in the terminal. You will need to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) first if you don't have it   

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/join) Account with your `BYUI-I email`. 
    * Use an [appropriate username](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/83967/does-my-employer-care-about-my-github-username). It will be the name of your public profile and website in Project 6. 
    * If you already have a GitHub account, you can add your BYUI-I email to your existing account. Go to `Settings` -> `Emails` -> `Add email address` and make it your primary email.

1. [Install](https://desktop.github.com/) GitHub Desktop  

1. __Git a Course Work Portfolio in GitHub__

        * __Select `byui-math-dept` as the `Owner` You should have been added to `byui-math-dept` by your teacher if you dont see it ask them to add you.
