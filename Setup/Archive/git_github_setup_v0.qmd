### Git what?

Git is a distributed version control tool that can manage a development project's source code history, while GitHub is a cloud based platform built around the Git tool. Git is a tool a developer installs locally on their computer, while GitHub is an online service that stores code pushed to it from computers running the Git tool. The key difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code, while GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources.[^1]

### Git?

The Git tool is popular with developers because is stays true to its purpose of versioning source code, managing commit histories and making it possible to share code between developers without deviating into peripheral fields. There is no feature bloat with Git. It does what it does, it does nothing else, and it makes no apologies for that fact.[^1]

### Github?

We’ve established that Git is a version control system, similar but better than the many alternatives available. So, what makes GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.[^2]
